A WORD FROM BOBBY FISCHER My book was written to help you play better Chess. It

can help you even if you don't know Chess notation and only play casually every now and then. It can help you if you are more experienced and have begun to play in tournaments. It can also help you if you don't know how to play at all.

For the beginner, I have included an Introduction on the moves. After reading this Introduction, beginners will be able to go through the book easily. However, a little practice playing at this point-even a game or two-would help.

The book teaches the common mating positions and combinations. Since checkmating is the object of the game, I think it is the most basic thing to learn. The checkmate is the "knockout" of Chess. The book starts with one-move mates and then develops these ideas. into mates of two, three, or four moves. You will be able to see these mates and apply them in your games.

Ordinarily, Chess books place you in a passive role.

You are expected to study the material and remember it. My book presents material as a tutor would and requires you to actively use the new ideas immediately by answering questions. After answering each question, you simply turn the page to find the right answer and my explanation. In this way, you will absorb the material thoroughly.

Programmed instruction, the method used in this book, is a new concept in teaching. It has been used previously in industry and schools with excellent results.

---

## Page 7

You can learn quickly and retain the material far better than with ordinary textbooks or lectures. Even the beginner will remember what I teach him and be able to use it immediately.

The book will do two things for you. First, it will teach you to analyze Chess problems better. Second, it will teach you the themes to look for so that you can find the right move fairly quickly, sometimes in just a few seconds. There are lots of positions in the book to practice on. You will begin to recognize when mates are possible and how to pull them off. Just be sure to start at the beginning and work through the book. If you run into difficulties and can't work out an answer by yourself, turn the page to find my answer and explanation.

You can pick up the book whenever you have a chance, then break off and continue later. You can set your own pace in figuring out your moves and answering the questions. You don't need a chessboard and a setonly this book and a few minutes to spare now and then.

After you finish this book, you can buy a small but serviceable chessboard and set very inexpensively. Even a good tournament set costs only eight or ten dollars.

Chess games are being played everywhere-on benches and tables in the park, at Chess clubs, YMCA's, high schools, colleges, army posts, prisons. Even by mail.

You shouldn't have any trouble in getting a game. I certainly hope that my book will help everyone to enjoy this wonderful game.

THE PHENOMENAL BOBBY FISCHER He was born Robert James Fischer on March 9, 1943, in Chicago, and grew up in Brooklyn. His sister, Joan, bought a Chess set when he was six, and together they learned the moves from the enclosed directions.

Bobby's development in Chess was unparalleled. By the time he was thirteen, he had achieved international prominence by winning what is generally known as the "Game of the Century." In 1957 he won the United States Chess Championship for the first time. He was fourteen. Bobby won or drew every single game in United States Chess competition for the next four years.

In the 1963-64 United States Chess Championship, Bobby achieved the unprecedented feat of winning all eleven games (without a single draw).

In the 1965 Capablanca Memorial Tournament, Bobby showed not only his great Chess ability but also his amazing stamina. Because of travel restrictions to Cuba, Bobby played all his opponents by teletype. This was undoubtedly one of his toughest tournaments.

In 1970 he began possibly the most famous drive in Chess history. He won seven straight games in international tournament play. Then, in May 1971, Bobby met Mark Taimanov, a Russian, in the challenge rounds of the World Championship.

He achieved the first shutout in the history of grandmaster play. The score was six games to none. He had won thirteen consecutive games. In the next round he

## Page 9

beat Denmark's Bent Larsen by the same score! Nineteen games in a row. Bobby next met ex world champion Tigran Petrosian, a Russian, in Buenos Aires. If he beat Petrosian, Bobby would play Boris Spassky, another Russian, for the world title. Bobby won the first game stretching his winging streak to twenty.

Then he caught a cold and lost a game. It was deadlocked for a short time until Bobby regained his are awarded for draws). Bobby ran the last four games As a German Chess expert told Life magazine, "No other master has such a terrific will to win. At the board he radiates danger, and even the strongest opponents tend to freeze, like rabbits, when they smell a panther. Even his weaknesses are dangerous. As white, his opening is predictable-you can make plans against it--but so strong that your plans almost never work. In middle game his precision and invention are fabulous, and in the end game you simply cannot beat him."

ABOUT THE COAUTHORS The coauthors of this book are Chess addicts, pioneers in the development of instructional techniques, and personal friends of long standing who have worked together on many projects.

DR. STUART MARGULIES, President of Ludi Education, a wholly owned subsidiary of Educational Design, Inc., has written a large number of instructional programs used in industry and the schools. His most famous contribution is the Effective Listening course, once

---

## Page 10

voted the outstanding programmed course in the country by a poll of experts in advanced learning techniques. Dr. Margulies is rated a Chess Master, and has tied for first place in the U.S. Amateur Chess Championships.

DONN MOSENFELDER, cofounder and Editor-in-Chief of Educational Design, Inc., is one of the leading innovators in the field of programmed instruction. He has designed and written a large number of programmed courses, and has also pioneered in the development of new approaches to such varied instructional problems as on-the-job training, classroom management, and the evaluation of systems of instruction.

Dr. Margulies and Mr. Mosenfelder began to think of writing a new and truly different Chess book-a book that would systematically develop a student's ability to recognize and exploit some of the infinite variations on basic tactical and strategic themes that actually occur in Chess play. But to do this they needed the insights that only a truly great Chess mind could provide they needed a collaborator who was both a great player and a great theorist, who could develop and evaluate positions, refine themes, and contribute insights from actual games of Grand Master caliber.

They found such a collaborator in Bobby Fischer. This book is the result. It teaches faster, more efficiently, and more enjoyably than conventional methods.

You, the student, progressively develop your skills as you learn to apply Bobby's principles. You will not be able to beat Bobby Fischer after you take this course, but one thing is guaranteed: you will become a far better Chess player than you were. The coauthors did.

INTRODUCTION: HOW TO PLAY CHESS This section is optional. It is intended for readers who do not know how to play Chess or for those who need to review the rules before starting the main part of this book.

If you are already familiar with the moves, turn to page 15.

## Page 12

A DESCRIPTION OF THE BOARD AND THE PIECES Chess is played by two players who move by turns. Play takes place on a chessboard that contains 64 squares, i.e., eight rows of eight squares. The squares are alternately colored white and black. The board should be arranged in such a way that each player has a white square in the corner at his right.

![Diagram](images/page_12_1_5430.png)

The Chessboard. The chess pieces are colored light and dark, and are designated as White and Black. Each side starts off with sixteen chessmen: 1 King 1 Queen 2 Rooks 2 Bishops 2 Knights 8 Pawns t

## Page 13

The starting arrangement of the pieces on the board, looking from the White side: Note that the Queen *starts from the square of its own color and that the King is placed next to its Queen. (Opposing Kings and Queens face each other.)

![Diagram](images/page_13_1_5427.png)

![Diagram](images/page_13_2_5428.png)

White always moves first.

MOVING AND CAPTURING A move is the transfer of a chess piece from one square to another. A capture is the removal of an opposing piece from the board; it is accomplished by actually removing the piece from its square and replacing it with the capturing piece. (You cannot capture your own piece.)

Powers of the Pieces The King can move or capture one square in any direction.

The King can move to any square marked with an x.

---

## Page 14

The King cannot move to squares where it may be captured by enemy pieces; nor can the King move to squares already occupied by its own pieces. The King

![Diagram](images/page_14_1_5423.png)

![Diagram](images/page_14_2_5424.png)

![Diagram](images/page_14_3_5425.png)

can capture an enemy piece within its moving range by removing the enemy piece from the board and by placing itself on the square occupied by the removed piece.

The King can capture the Pawn as shown: The Queen can move or capture as far as it wants in any direction-horizontally, vertically, or diagonallyunless it is obstructed by a piece belonging to either side.

The Queen can move to any square marked with an x.

---

## Page 15

![Diagram](images/page_15_1_5419.png)

![Diagram](images/page_15_2_5420.png)

![Diagram](images/page_15_3_5421.png)

Here, too, the Queen

can move to any square it cannot move to the square occupied by its own Rook or the squares that lie beyond the Rook.

The Queen can move to any square marked with the Black Bishop by removing it from the board and placing itself on the square occupied by the Bishop. But, it cannot move to the squares that lie beyond the Bishop.

The Rook can move or capture horizontally or vertically like the Queen, but lacks the power to move diagonally.

The Rook can move to any square marked with an X.

---

## Page 16

The Rook also captures by removing the enemy piece and occupying its square.

![Diagram](images/page_16_1_5415.png)

![Diagram](images/page_16_2_5416.png)

![Diagram](images/page_16_3_5417.png)

The Bishop is limited to diagonal moves or captures.

It cannot move horizontally or vertically. The Bishop's moves.

Since the Bishop can only move diagonally, it is confined to squares of the same color throughout the game. The Bishop can capture any enemy piece within its moving range.

---

## Page 17

The Knight moves differently from any other piece. Its crooked move often confuses beginners, so I will describe it in three ways: The Knight moves to squares reached by going two squares vertically or horizontally, and one square to the left or right.

![Diagram](images/page_17_1_5411.png)

![Diagram](images/page_17_2_5412.png)

![Diagram](images/page_17_3_5413.png)

The Knight moves to squares reached by going one square diagonally and then one square horizontally or vertically in roughly the same direction.

The Knight moves to the eight nearby squares which are not in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal straight line from the square it occupies.

---

## Page 18

Note that the Knight always lands on a square of a different color from the one it started on.

![Diagram](images/page_18_1_5407.png)

![Diagram](images/page_18_2_5408.png)

![Diagram](images/page_18_3_5409.png)

The Knight is the only piece that can jump over other pieces (either its own or the enemy's) in the course of its move.

For example, in the initial position, White could start with any of four Knight moves, as shown.

The Knight captures in the same way that it moves: by replacing the enemy piece on the square to which it moves.

---

## Page 19

The Pawn, unlike the other pieces, moves in one fashion and captures in another. Also, it can only advance, never retreat. The Pawn moves forward-never backward-one square at a time, as shown: However, when the Pawn is on its original square, it has the option of advancing one or two squares on its first move.

![Diagram](images/page_19_1_5404.png)

![Diagram](images/page_19_2_5405.png)

The Pawn can move to square A or square B.

---

## Page 20

The Pawn captures diagonally forward to the left or right, as shown: How the Pawn captures.

![Diagram](images/page_20_1_5401.png)

![Diagram](images/page_20_2_5402.png)

In the position shown below, the White Pawn on the left can capture the Knight; however, it cannot move one square ahead, since it is blocked by the Black Bishop. Neither Pawn on the right can move since each blocks the other.

---

## Page 21

Remember that the Pawn, like the other pieces, replaces the piece it captures. * Position before the Pawn captures.

![Diagram](images/page_21_1_5398.png)

![Diagram](images/page_21_2_5399.png)

After the Pawn captures. The Pawn then proceeds as shown by the broken line, unless it changes files (the vertical rows) when making another capture.

---

## Page 22

Special Moves Castling is a move that allows you to place your King on a square that is reasonably safe from enemy attack.

![Diagram](images/page_22_1_5487.png)

![Diagram](images/page_22_2_5488.png)

![Diagram](images/page_22_3_5489.png)

![Diagram](images/page_22_4_5490.png)

![Diagram](images/page_22_5_5491.png)

It is the only move that involves a move of two pieces on a player's turn. Castling is accomplished by the King and either Rook as shown below: Position before castling on the King's side of the board.

After castling "Kingside." Position before castling on the Queen's side of the board.

After castling "Queenside." Black castles as shown:

---

## Page 23

Note: The King is moved two squares toward the Rook he intends to castle with, then the Rook is placed on the other side of the King.

![Diagram](images/page_23_1_5395.png)

![Diagram](images/page_23_2_5396.png)

Castling may not be played when: 1) The King is in check, i.e., under enemy attack. 2) Either the King or Rook involved has previously moved. 3) Pieces (either side) are between the King and the Rook. 4) Squares passed over or landed on by the King are under enemy attack.

Pawn Promotion: When a Pawn reaches the eighth rank (the enemy's back rank) it is promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight of its own color, according to the player's choice.

Capturing En Passant (in passing): This special capturing power of a Pawn applies only to the capture of a Pawn by a Pawn, in a specific type of situation. That situation occurs when a Pawn on the second rank (horizontal row) uses its option to advance two squares on its first move and bypasses an enemy Pawn as shown here.

White moves. Now it is Black's move..

---

## Page 24

Black now has the option of capturing the White Pawn as if it had advanced one square.

![Diagram](images/page_24_1_5392.png)

![Diagram](images/page_24_2_5393.png)

Before Black captures en passant. After Black captures en passant.

If the bypassed Pawn does not exercise its option of capturing en passant at once, it cannot do so later on in the game.

RELATIVE VALUES OF PIECES Numerically, the relative values of the various pieces

can be expressed as follows: Pawn = 1; Knight = 3; Bishop 3.25; Rook = 5; Queen = 9; King = Infinity (if you lose the King, you lose the game).

NOTE: You may now start the program on page 15. If you are new to Chess, you may find that you need to review some of the rules as you are working through the first part of the program. If you do, you may turn back here and "brush up" before continuing.

# Chapter 1: ELEMENTS OF CHECKMATE

---

### Frame 1

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK In preparing this book, I did not want to write just an ordinary Chess book-so I used a new method called programmed instruction. Instead of merely presenting information that you have to try to understand, this book, called a program, actively teaches the material it contains.

A program consists of a series of small informational steps called frames. Each frame presents information and usually requires a written response from you, the learner. Some frames will ask you to check a "yes" or "no" answer, others will ask you to write a sentence of explanation, and most will ask you to indicate a correct move by drawing an arrow on a diagram. My answer to each frame appears in the answer box at the top of the next right-hand page. This allows you to compare your answer with mine after you've had a chance to work out your own response. You are not asked questions about information that hasn't been taught in the program. You will notice that each frame builds on positions previously presented and prepares for positions to follow.

When you reach the last page of this book, turn the book around and continue working on the right-hand pages.

When you finish the book, you will find that you can "finish off" your opponent with mating combinations you never would have seen before.

You may now turn to frame number 2 on the next right-hand page. I hope you will enjoy learning Chess from BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS.

---

### Frame 2

DIAGRAMS Diagrams may seem puzzling at first, but once you know what each symbol stands for they are very simple. Let's review the pieces and their symbols one by one: King Queen Rook symbol symbol symbol Bishop Knight Pawn

symbol symbol symbol (continued)

---

### Frame 2

![Diagram](images/page_28_1_5493.png)

(continued) The initial position in diagram form: Black Pawns move in this direction.

White Pawns move in this direction

![Diagram](images/page_28_1_5493.png)

In diagrams, the White side of the board is always placed on the bottom.

---

### Frame 3

TO THE EXPERIENCED PLAYER If you have played Chess several times and are confident that you understand checkmate, you may now turn to frame 39 on page 60 and begin the program.

You should turn back to frame 5 if you find frame 39, or any of the frames immediately following it, difficult to answer.

If you haven't played much Chess, you should turn to the next frame and begin.

---

### Frame 4

![Diagram](images/page_30_1_5440.png)

THE OBJECT OF CHESS The object of Chess is to attack the enemy King in such a way that it cannot escape capture. Once this is done the King is "checkmated" and the game is terminated.

Therefore, whenever a King is under attack ("check"), it must escape that attack before the game can go on.

Consider the following position: Diagram A Black is in check.

The White Rook is checking the Black King. There are three ways of escaping check: 1)

Capturing the checking piece (Bishop: arrow 1). 2) Interposing a piece between the King and the checking piece (Rook: arrow 2). 3) Fleeing to a square where the King will not be in check (arrow 3). (continued)

---

### Frame 4

![Diagram](images/page_31_1_4600.png)

![Diagram](images/page_31_2_5449.png)

(continued) Remember, if a King is in check and has no way of escaping, then that King is "checkmated." Consider this position: Diagram B Checkmate!

Here the checking piece (Queen) can't be captured because it is protected by the Rook. Black has no possible interpositions and all the potential fleeing squares (A, B, C, D) are attacked by the White Queen. Black is in check and has no means of escaping: Black is checkmated. The game is over.

Compare the position above with the one that follows: Diagram C (Black to move.) (What move can Black make?)

In diagram B, Black is in check and has no moves to escape from check. But in diagram C, Black is not in check; any move with his King would put his King in check, and his Pawn is blocked. Black has no legal move. This situation is known as "stalemate" and the game is drawn.

---

### Frame 5

![Diagram](images/page_32_1_4627.png)

![Diagram](images/page_32_2_4628.png)

Let's see how checkmate is accomplished and how your opponent might escape it.

Observe the difference between the two positions in each of the groups below: White has just moved his Rook down, giving check.

But the Black King

can capture the checking White Rook. Black is saved.

In this slightly different position, the attacked King cannot capture the White Rook. As a matter of fact, Black has no defense; he is checkmated. The game is over.

---

### Frame 5 (continued)

![Diagram](images/page_33_1_4623.png)

![Diagram](images/page_33_2_4624.png)

![Diagram](images/page_33_3_4625.png)

![Diagram](images/page_33_4_5447.png)

B1. The White Queen has cornered Black's King, but Black's King can capture the checking White Queen.

The checking White Queen is protected by the Bishop. The Black King cannot capture. Black is checkmated.

C1. Again, the Black King can capture Here the Queen, protected by a Rook, the attacking Queen. has checkmated Black.

---

### Frame 6

![Diagram](images/page_34_1_4621.png)

Observe this position; then decide whether the Black King can capture the checking White piece.

The White Queen is giving check. The Black King:

☐ can capture

☐ cannot capture

---

### Frame 6 - Answer

cannot capture

(NOTE: The Queen is protected by the Bishop; therefore the King cannot capture. In fact, the King has no safe place to move to. So Black is checkmated.)

---

### Frame 7

Again, observe the position; then decide whether the Black King can capture the checking White piece.

![Diagram](images/page_35_1_4619.png)

The White Queen is giving check. The Black King:

☐ can capture

☐ cannot capture

---

### Frame 7 - Answer

can capture

(NOTE: The Bishop is not protecting the Queen.)

---

### Frame 8

![Diagram](images/page_36_1_4617.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture checking White Rook

☐ cannot capture checking White Rook

---

### Frame 8 - Answer

can capture checking White Rook

---

### Frame 9

![Diagram](images/page_37_1_4615.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture checking White Rook

☐ cannot capture checking White Rook

---

### Frame 9 - Answer

cannot capture checking White Rook

(The Rook is protected by the Knight.)

---

### Frame 10

![Diagram](images/page_38_1_4613.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture checking White Rook

☐ cannot capture checking White Rook

---

### Frame 10 - Answer

can capture checking White Rook

---

### Frame 11

![Diagram](images/page_39_1_4611.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture checking White Rook

☐ cannot capture checking White Rook

---

### Frame 11 - Answer

cannot capture checking White Rook (Black is "mated"&mdash;or checkmated. Remember, the King can only move one square, so the Rook is beyond the Black King's reach.)

---

### Frame 12

Sometimes the Black King can escape from check by fleeing to a "flight" square.

Observe the difference between the two positions in each of the groups below:

![Diagram](images/page_40_1_4608.png)

A1. The Black King can *flee* (as shown by arrow) from a check by the White Knight.

![Diagram](images/page_40_2_4609.png)

A2. In this slightly different position Black's King, in check, has no flight squares and no other defense-he is mated. We call this a "smothered" mate because the Black King, hemmed in by its own pieces, has no place to move when checked by the Knight.

![Diagram](images/page_41_1_4603.png)

B1. The White Queen has checked, but Black's King can flee to the square indicated.

![Diagram](images/page_41_2_4604.png)

B2. Here White's Queen not only checks, but also covers the enemy King's flight square. Black has no place to flee safely, so he is mated.

![Diagram](images/page_41_3_4605.png)

C1. The White Rook checks. Black's King flees as indicated.

![Diagram](images/page_41_4_4606.png)

C2. White's Bishop covers the flight square. Therefore, Black is mated.

---

### Frame 13

Now you decide what Black can do in this position.

![Diagram](images/page_42_1_4731.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture its attacker

☐ can flee

☐ can do neither

---

### Frame 13 - Answer

can do neither (Black is mated. The Bishops team up powerfully here.)

---

### Frame 14
Again, observe the position and decide what the Black King can do.

![Diagram](images/page_43_1_4729.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture attacker

☐ can flee

☐ can do neither

---

### Frame 14 - Answer

can flee (One square to your left. Work it out.)

---

### Frame 15

![Diagram](images/page_44_1_4727.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture attacker

☐ can flee

☐ can do neither

---

### Frame 15 - Answer

can do neither (White's Pawn stops Black's King from fleeing.)

---

### Frame 16

![Diagram](images/page_45_1_4725.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture attacker

☐ can flee

☐ can do neither

---

### Frame 16 - Answer

can capture attacker

---

### Frame 17

Here the lowly Pawn is giving check:

![Diagram](images/page_46_1_4723.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture attacker

☐ can flee

☐ can do neither

---

### Frame 17 - Answer

can do neither (Black is mated.)

---

### Frame 18

![Diagram](images/page_47_1_4721.png)

Black King:

☐ can capture attacker

☐ can flee

☐ can do neither

---

### Frame 18 - Answer

can do neither

(Checking Rook is protected by Queen. Black is mated.)

---

### Frame 19

Draw an arrow to show how I (Black) mated Paul Keres in this position.

Fischer
![Diagram](images/page_48_1_5445.png)
Keres

---

### Frame 19 - Answer

Fischer
![Diagram](images/page_49_1_4718.png)
Keres

NOTE: This mate actually happened! The position is taken from our game in the 1959 Bled Tournament (Yugoslavia). Since 1938 Keres has been considered one of the very top players in the world.

---

### Frame 20

![Diagram](images/page_49_2_4719.png)

White's Rook has checked. The Black King, having no flight square, is mated.

Note the lettered squares, then identify the White piece that guards each of them. (For example, if the Black King were to move to square A, which White piece could capture it?) I'll do the first one to give you the idea.

ROOK guards square A

... guards square B

... guards square C

... guards square D

... guards square E

---

### Frame 20 - Answer

Pawn

(guards square B)

Knight (guards square C)

Pawn (guards square D)

Rook (guards square E)

---

### Frame 21

Now try this one: 

![Diagram](images/page_50_1_4716.png)

Identify the White piece that guards each square:

... guards square A

... guards square B

... guards square C

... guards square D

... guards square E

By the way, which White piece is giving check?

---

### Frame 21 - Answer

Queen

(guards square A)

Bishop (guards square B)

Knight (guards square C)

King (guards square D)

Pawn (guards square E)

No White piece is giving check. (Black has no possible move; therefore, the game is a *stalemate*, or draw.)

---

### Frame 22

Observe this position; then draw an arrow to show White's mating move:

![Diagram](images/page_51_1_4714.png)

---

### Frame 22 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_52_1_4711.png)

(This was taken from my game with Bent Larsen \[Black\] in the 1958 Interzonal Tournament, in Portoroz, Yugoslavia.)

---

### Frame 23

Black is in check again. Draw an arrow pointing to the one square to which Black can flee:

![Diagram](images/page_52_2_4712.png)

---

### Frame 23 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_53_1_4708.png)

---

### Frame 24

Again, draw an arrow to show Black's flight square:

![Diagram](images/page_53_2_4709.png)

---

### Frame 24 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_54_1_4705.png)

---

### Frame 25

Here's a common position in which Black appears to be checkmated. Actually he can escape, but in a slightly different way from what you've been accustomed to.

Draw an arrow on the diagram to show how Black's King gets out of check:

![Diagram](images/page_54_2_4706.png)

---

### Frame 25 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_55_1_4702.png)

(Black has only one place to go, and it just happens that a White Rook is occupying that square.

The King saves himself by capturing the Rook-so much the better.)

---

### Frame 26

![Diagram](images/page_55_2_4703.png)

Can White save himself by playing King-takes-Rook in this position?

☐ yes

☐ no (checkmate)

---

### Frame 26 - Answer

no

(checkmate)

(In this case the Queen, which is giving check, also protects the Rook. White is checkmated.)

---

### Frame 27


Remember that one King can help trap the other. In fact, in the later stages of the game when most of the pieces have been traded off, the King can be a very valuable offensive piece-and not one that you have to hide away in the corner.

Observe the positions below:

![Diagram](images/page_56_1_4699.png)
A

![Diagram](images/page_56_2_4700.png)
B

Black is checkmated in:

☐ position A only

☐ position B only

☐ both positions

☐ neither position


---

### Frame 27 - Answer

position A only

(Note that in position A the White King hems in Black's King while the Rook gives check. This is a common type of mate. In position B, Black has a fleeing square that gets him safely out of check. Look again for it if you didn't notice it.)

---

### Frame 28

Now that you have the idea, observe this position:

![Diagram](images/page_57_1_4697.png)

Is Black checkmated?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 28 - Answer

yes

(The Queen gives check and covers all the fleeing squares, while White's King protects the Queen from capture.)

---

### Frame 29

Sometimes Black can avoid check or mate by capturing with a piece other than his King.

Observe the difference between the two positions in each group below:

![Diagram](images/page_58_2_4695.png)
A1. White's Queen, protected by the Rook, has mated.

![Diagram](images/page_58_1_4694.png)
A2. The same position, except for the Black Bishop, which can capture the attacker.

![Diagram](images/page_59_1_4689.png)
B1. White's Queen, protected by Bishop, mates.

![Diagram](images/page_59_2_4690.png)
B2. But here the Black Knight can capture the attacker.

![Diagram](images/page_59_3_4691.png)
C1. The White Rook mates. The Bishop prevents the Black Rook from capturing the White Rook and thereby saving the game.

![Diagram](images/page_59_4_4692.png)
C2. With the Black Bishop out of the way, Black's Rook captures White's Rook.

---

### Frame 30

Observe the following position; then determine Black's defense, if any.

![Diagram](images/page_60_1_4687.png)

What is Black's defense?

☐ King-takes-Queen

☐ King flees

☐ other piece-takes-Queen

☐ no defense: checkmate

---

### Frame 30 - Answer

no defense: checkmate

---

### Frame 31

![Diagram](images/page_61_1_4685.png)

Check Black's defensive move: 

☐ King-takes-Rook

☐ King flees

☐ other piece-takes-Rook

☐ no defense: checkmate

---

### Frame 31 - Answer

other piece-takes-Rook

(In this case the Knight is the capturing piece.)

---

### Frame 32

![Diagram](images/page_62_1_4683.png)

What does Black play?

☐ King-takes-Rook

☐ King flees

☐ other piece-takes-Rook

☐ no defense: checkmate

---

### Frame 32 - Answer

King-takes-Rook

---

### Frame 33

![Diagram](images/page_63_1_4681.png)

What is Black's defense?

☐ King-takes-Queen

☐ King flees

☐ other piece-takes-Queen

☐ no defense: checkmate

---

### Frame 33 - Answer

King flees

---

### Frame 34

What is Black's saving move in this example? 

![Diagram](images/page_64_1_4679.png)

☐ King-takes-Bishop

☐ King flees

☐ other piece-takes-Bishop

☐ no defense: checkmate

---

### Frame 34 - Answer

King flees

---

### Frame 35

![Diagram](images/page_65_1_4677.png)

What can Black do to escape check?

☐ King-takes-Knight

☐ King flees

☐ other piece-takes-Knight

☐ no defense: checkmate

---

### Frame 35 - Answer

other piece-takes-Knight

(In this case, the Pawn saves Black by capturing the checking White Knight.)

---

### Frame 36


Another way for Black to escape check is to "interpose" one of his pieces between the checking piece and his King.

Observe the following positions:


![Diagram](images/page_66_1_4674.png)
A. White's Rook has checked. Black has no defense and is mated.

![Diagram](images/page_66_2_4675.png)
B. But in this similar position, Black's Rook prevents mate by interposing (as shown by arrow).

![Diagram](images/page_67_1_4671.png)
C. Here Black's Bishop interposes, defending against mate by the White Rook.

![Diagram](images/page_67_2_4672.png)

D. This time the Black Knight interposes.

### Frame 37

In this position, the White Rook is checking:

![Diagram](images/page_68_1_4669.png)

Which Black piece can defend against the check?

What does that Black piece do? 

☐ captures 

☐ interposes

---

### Frame 37 - Answer

the Knight interposes

---

### Frame 38

![Diagram](images/page_69_1_4667.png)

Which Black piece can defend against this check?

What does that Black piece do?

☐ captures

☐ interposes

---

### Frame 38 - Answer

Pawn captures (the Queen)

---

### Frame 39


In this and the next few frames you will be shown various positions: in some Black is mated; in others he can defend by *capturing* the White attacker, *moving his King*, or *interposing*. You will be asked to determine Black's defense, if any exists.

![Diagram](images/page_70_1_4665.png)

Is Black mated by White's Bishop?

☐ yes

☐ no

If not, draw an arrow on the diagram to show Black's defense.

---

### Frame 39 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_71_1_4662.png)

no

(Black is not mated; the Rook interposes, as shown.)

---

### Frame 40

![Diagram](images/page_71_2_4663.png)

Is Black mated?

☐ yes

☐ no

If not, draw an arrow to show his defense.

---

### Frame 40 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_72_1_4659.png)

no

(King flees as shown.)

---

### Frame 41

![Diagram](images/page_72_2_4660.png)

Observe the board carefully. This is a tricky one. Is Black mated?

☐ yes

☐ no

If not, draw an arrow to show his defense.

---

### Frame 41 - Answer

yes

(You have to watch those Knights!)

---

### Frame 42

Here's another tricky one:

![Diagram](images/page_73_1_4657.png)

The position is:

☐ checkmate

☐ not checkmate

If you answer "not checkmate," draw an arrow to show Black's defense.

---

### Frame 42 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_74_1_4654.png)

not checkmate

(Queen takes Queen, as shown.)

---

### Frame 43

You will now see more complex positions that require careful consideration of *every* piece on the board.

![Diagram](images/page_74_2_4655.png)

Which Black piece can defend against mate?

How does this piece defend?

☐ by capturing attacker

☐ by interposing

---

### Frame 43 - Answer

the Rook by interposing

(You have to watch all of the pieces on the board and observe how they affect the position.)

---

### Frame 44

Here's a position from one of my games in which I was Black.

Assume White's Pawn captures the Black Knight. Draw an arrow to show how I would then mate in one move:

Fischer
![Diagram](images/page_75_1_4652.png)
Gligorich

---

### Frame 44 - Answer

After White's Pawn takes Knight, Queen mates as from my game with shown:

Fischer
![Diagram](images/page_76_1_4649.png)
Gligorich

NOTE: This position is from game my with Gligorich in Bled, Yugoslavia (1961). Gligorich has been Yugoslavian Champion many times. He has qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the World Championship three times.

Actually, my opponent made a different move (Knight-takes-Bishop), and after some complicated play the game was eventually drawn.

---

### Frame 45

Draw an arrow to show Black's defense against checkmate:

![Diagram](images/page_76_2_4650.png)

---

### Frame 45 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_77_1_4646.png)

(Remember, watch the whole board!)

---

### Frame 46

Observe the board carefully:

![Diagram](images/page_77_2_4647.png)

Can White's Rook mate by capturing the Pawn, as shown?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 46 - Answer

yes

(White's Rook is protected by the Bishop.)

---

### Frame 47

![Diagram](images/page_78_1_4644.png)

Is Black mated in this position?

☐ yes

☐ no

If not, draw the usual arrow to show the defense.

---

### Frame 47 - Answer

yes

(Black is mated. White sacrificed his Queen to achieve this mate. Note Black's Bishop next to White's King.)

---

### Frame 48

Here is a position from one of my games. Draw an arrow showing how Black can mate:

![Diagram](images/page_79_1_4642.png)

---

### Frame 48 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_80_1_4638.png)

NOTE: This position is from my game with Letelier (White) in the Leipzig team tournament, 1960. Letelier resigned rather than permit the Bishop to mate.

---

### Frame 49

PINS

Observe the *differences* in each of the following three pairs:

![Diagram](images/page_80_2_4639.png)
A1. In this position, Black's Queen can capture the attacker.

![Diagram](images/page_80_3_4640.png)
A2. But here, Black's Queen cannot capture the attacker. The Queen is "pinned" by White's Bishop (i.e., capturing would expose the Black King to capture).

![Diagram](images/page_81_1_4633.png)
B1. Black's Knight can interpose to defend against the White Rook's check.

![Diagram](images/page_81_2_4634.png)
B2. The Black Knight *cannot* interpose (it's pinned by White Queen).

![Diagram](images/page_81_3_4635.png)
C1. White's Queen can check and mate.

![Diagram](images/page_81_4_4636.png)

C2. The White Queen *cannot* check (it's pinned by Black Rook).

---

### Frame 50

Black is mated. A fantastic position! Black's Queen, Bishop and Knight are all "pinned" and thus unable to come to the defense of the Black King.

![Diagram](images/page_82_1_4743.png)

What White piece prevents Black's Queen from capturing the checking Rook?

What White piece prevents the Black Bishop from interposing?

What White piece prevents Black's Knight from interposing?

---

### Frame 50 - Answer

Queen

Rook (next to White King) 

Bishop

---

### Frame 51

White has several checks, but only one mate.

![Diagram](images/page_83_1_4741.png)

Which move mates?

☐ Bishop-takes-Queen

☐ Queen-takes-Queen

☐ Queen-takes-Pawn

☐ Knight checks

---

### Frame 51 - Answer

Knight checks

(Black Queen is pinned by Bishop; Black Pawn is pinned by Queen. Whenever a piece is pinned to the King, it loses most of its powers. Always examine pins carefully because they are the seeds of many combinations.)

---

### Frame 52

Observe all pieces carefully!

![Diagram](images/page_84_1_4739.png)

a. Is Queen-checks (as shown) mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

b. Is Rook-checks mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 52 - Answer

a. yes

(Black's Queen is pinned and cannot interpose.)

b. no

(Black's Bishop can capture!)

---

### Frame 53

![Diagram](images/page_85_1_4737.png)

Why *can't* White's Queen mate as shown?

---

### Frame 53 - Answer

White's Queen is pinned by the Black Rook! Otherwise it could mate, since Black's Queen and Knight are both pinned.

---

### Frame 54

Let's review the rule of Pawn promotion. When your Pawn advances all the way to the other end of the board, it becomes a Queen, Rook, Bishop or Knight, according to your choice.

![Diagram](images/page_86_1_4735.png)

Here White's Pawn can advance and mate Black. To do so, it must become a:

☐ Bishop

☐ Knight

☐ Queen

☐ Rook

---

### Frame 54 - Answer

Queen

(Promotion to a Rook would not work because the Black King could escape to a flight square. Usually it is best to promote a Pawn to a Queen, since the Queen is the strongest piece. On rare occasions, however, promoting to a weaker piece \[e.g., Knight\] is a better play.)

---

### Frame 55

Believe it or not, White *can* mate in this position: The correct White move is:

![Diagram](images/page_87_1_4733.png)

☐ Pawn advances straight ahead and becomes a Knight

☐ Pawn advances straight ahead and becomes a Queen

☐ Pawn takes Bishop and becomes a Queen

☐ Pawn takes Bishop and becomes a Bishop

---

### Frame 55 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_88_1_4888.png)

Pawn advances straight ahead and becomes a Knight

(Black is mated, as shown. Had White made a Queen instead, Black would have queened his Pawn too&mdash;with check.)

---

### Frame 56

In this position, a White Pawn can promote and mate:

![Diagram](images/page_88_2_4889.png)

To mate, the Pawn should:

☐ advance straight ahead

☐ take the Knight

What must it become if it is to mate?

---

### Frame 56 - Answer

advance straight ahead

Queen *or* Rook

---

### Frame 57

Here is a review of some of the material you've learned.

Observe this position:

![Diagram](images/page_89_1_4886.png)

Can White's Queen mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

Can White's Knight/mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 57 - Answer

no

(Neither of the Queen checks will be mate.)

yes

(Black Pawn is pinned by White Rook.)

---

### Frame 58

Here is a complex position. Observe all pieces carefully.

![Diagram](images/page_90_1_4884.png)

The Queen has several checks. The only one that mates is at square:

☐ A

☐ B

☐ C

☐ D

---

### Frame 58 - Answer

D

---

### Frame 59

Observe the board carefully.

White's Queen and Knight have checks.

Draw an arrow showing the mating White move:

![Diagram](images/page_91_1_4882.png)

---

### Frame 59 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_92_1_4879.png)

(This position is a smothered mate&mdash;Black's own pieces prevent him from fleeing from check.)

---

### Frame 60

Here White's Pawn, Queen and Rook have checks.

Draw an arrow to show the one mating move:

![Diagram](images/page_92_2_4880.png)

---

### Frame 60 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_93_1_4876.png)

---

### Frame 61

![Diagram](images/page_93_2_4877.png)

White's Pawn and Queen can check, but only one of them mates.

Which one?

☐ Pawn

☐ Queen

---

### Frame 61 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_94_1_4873.png)

Pawn

(Black's Rook is pinned, but would be *free to interpose if the White Queen checked*.)

---

### Frame 62

In choosing the check in this position, you must be careful not to allow the Black King any flight squares.

![Diagram](images/page_94_2_4874.png)

Which White move (as shown) mates?

☐ move by White *Queen*

☐ move by White *Rook*

---

### Frame 62 - Answer

move by White *Rook*

![Diagram](images/page_95_1_4869.png)

![Diagram](images/page_95_2_4870.png)

(The Queen check would allow Black two fleeing squares, as shown above.)

---

### Frame 63

Here's a fancy one.

When the White Rook moves, the White *Bishop* will be checking. (This is called a "discovered check.") The Rook has an opportunity to move to a square that cuts off the Black King's flight squares.

Draw an arrow to show the mate:

![Diagram](images/page_95_3_4871.png)

---

### Frame 63 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_96_1_4866.png)

---

### Frame 64

In this and the following frame, *you* will have to select the mates from among a number of tempting checks. I've made the positions a little tricky, so be careful!

In the first position there are *four* checks, but only *one* mate. Be accurate! Black threatens mate, too.

Draw the usual arrow to show White's mating move:

![Diagram](images/page_96_2_4867.png)

---

### Frame 64 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_97_1_4863.png)

---

### Frame 65

Here is the second position. Again, show the mate by an arrow.

![Diagram](images/page_97_2_4864.png)

---

### Frame 65 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_98_1_4860.png)

(The Black Rook, pinned by one of White's Bishops, stands by powerless while the other White Bishop protects the Queen from capture by Black's King. The Queen cuts off Black's one flight square&mdash;Black could flee if White moved his Queen straight down to the last rank.)

---

### Frame 66

In this next series of frames you will be shown various positions. In some, White can mate Black in one move; in others, White has many checks, but no mates. You will have to decide whether White can mate, and if so, how.

![Diagram](images/page_98_2_4861.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate in one move

☐ White cannot mate

If there is a mate, draw an arrow to show White's mating move.

---

### Frame 66 - Answer

White can mate in one move

![Diagram](images/page_99_1_4857.png)

---

### Frame 67

![Diagram](images/page_99_2_4858.png)

Can White mate in one move?

☐ yes

☐ no

If "yes," draw an arrow to show White's mating move.

---

### Frame 69 - Answer

no

(The Knight check is met by the Queen's capture of the Knight! This position is from my game with Otteson \[White\] in 1957.)

---

### Frame 70

![Diagram](images/page_102_1_4937.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate in one move

☐ White cannot mate

If there is a mate, draw an arrow to show the mating move.

---

# Chapter 2: THE BACK-RANK MATES

This chapter presents the basic elements of the most common of all mating combinations: the back-rank mates (i.e., mates accomplished on the row of squares at the near or far side of the board). These mates often involve several moves for both sides, some of which are fairly simple and some not so simple.

---

### Frame 80

USEFUL VERSUS USELESS INTERPOSITION

![Diagram](images/page_114_1_4907.png)

A. Black is in check.

He can interpose his Bishop, as shown, but the White Rook will simply capture it and mate. In this case, the interposition is *useless*.

![Diagram](images/page_114_2_4908.png)

B. But here when the Black Bishop interposes it will be protected by the Black King. This interposition is *useful*&mdash;White cannot mate.

![Diagram](images/page_114_3_4909.png)

C. Here Black's Rook can make a useful interposition; it will be protected by the other Black Rook.

![Diagram](images/page_114_4_4910.png)

D. In this position, either the Black Knight or the Black Bishop can make a useful interposition since one will protect the other.

---

### Frame 81

Observe the position and then decide whether Black has a useful interposition against the check.

![Diagram](images/page_115_1_4905.png)

Does Black have a useful interposition?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 81 - Answer

yes

(Black has a useful interposition, with either the Rook or the Bishop.)

---

### Frame 82

![Diagram](images/page_116_1_4903.png)

Does Black have a useful interposition?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 82 - Answer

yes

(Black has a useful interposition, with the Knight.)

---

### Frame 83

![Diagram](images/page_117_1_4901.png)

Does Black have a useful interposition?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 83 - Answer

no

(Black's interpositions are useless; therefore, White mates.)

---

### Frame 84

![Diagram](images/page_118_1_4899.png)

Does Black have a useful interposition?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 84 - Answer

yes

---

### Frame 85

Draw an arrow to show the useful interposition for Black in this position:

![Diagram](images/page_119_1_4897.png)

---

### Frame 85 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_120_1_4894.png)

(The Bishop move is the only useful interposition. The Black Queen is pinned and the Black Rook, if it interposes, will not be protected by the pinned Queen.)

---

### Frame 86

Draw an arrow to show the useful interposition here:

![Diagram](images/page_120_2_4895.png)

---

### Frame 86 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_121_1_4891.png)

---

### Frame 87

![Diagram](images/page_121_2_4892.png)

What is Black's defense against checkmate in this position?

---

### Frame 87 - Answer

Black's Knight takes Queen! (The only saving move.)

---

### Frame 88

Observe the combination in the diagrams below:

![Diagram](images/page_122_1_4948.png)

A. White's Queen and two Rooks are lined up on the "open" file leading down to Black's back rank.

![Diagram](images/page_122_2_4949.png)

B. White's Queen has checked, and the Black Rook must capture it.

![Diagram](images/page_123_1_4944.png)

C. White now plays Rook-takes-Rook, thus giving check.

![Diagram](images/page_123_2_4945.png)

D. Black must recapture (Queen takes Rook).

![Diagram](images/page_123_3_4946.png)

E. And now the other White Rook can mate.

---

### Frame 89

DETERMINING AMOUNT OF POWER NEEDED TO MATE

Study the following positions:

![Diagram](images/page_124_2_5453.png)

A. This first position is an example of two against two: the two White Rooks are ready to give check on the same Black back-rank square; the Black Rook and Black Bishop are ready to capture. White cannot mate.

![Diagram](images/page_124_1_4942.png)

B. Here again we have two against two: two White Rooks attacking the same backrank square; two pieces, the Knight and the King, act as defenders. There is no mate for White.

![Diagram](images/page_125_1_4939.png)

C. In this position, White has more power (three against two) and can mate. Rook checks; Knight takes Rook; Rook takes Knight, mate. In the final position, the second White Rook is supported by the Bishop. Without the Bishop, Black could play King-takes-Rook.

![Diagram](images/page_125_2_4940.png)

D. Two against one: the White Queen and Rook attack the same back-rank square; only a Rook defends. White mates.

![Diagram](images/page_126_1_4850.png)

E. Also two against one. Note that the Black Rook does not count because it will be captured on the first check. White mates.

![Diagram](images/page_126_2_4851.png)

F. Here it's two against two, with no White mate. A third White piece (the Bishop) attacks the same back-rank square, but *will not give check*.

![Diagram](images/page_126_3_4852.png)

G. The White Queen is pinned and unable to move forward, but it can still play a supportive role. The White Rook move is checkmate.

---

### Frame 90

The next series of frames will show various positions. You will be asked to determine whether White has enough power to mate on Black's back rank. You must observe all of the pieces on the board.

![Diagram](images/page_127_1_4848.png)

Does White have enough power to mate on Black's back rank?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 90 - Answer

yes

(White has the power to mate-four against three. The last check will be given by Rook supported by Bishop.)

---

### Frame 91

![Diagram](images/page_128_1_4846.png)

Does White have enough power to mate on Black's back rank?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 91 - Answer

no

(There is no mate here-two against two: Black Bishop and Rook against two Rooks.)

---

### Frame 92

![Diagram](images/page_129_1_4844.png)

Does White have enough power to mate on Black's back rank?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 92 - Answer

yes

(White has the power: White Queen and two Rooks against only two defenders.)

---

### Frame 93

![Diagram](images/page_130_1_4842.png)

Does White have enough power to mate on Black's back rank?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 93 - Answer

no

(One against one. White cannot mate. The White Bishop and Knight attack the back-rank square, but do not check when they land on it&mdash;so, as far as the back-rank mating combination is concerned, they don't really count.)

---

### Frame 94

![Diagram](images/page_131_1_4840.png)

Does White have enough power to mate on Black's back rank?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 94 - Answer

yes

(It's two against one. The White Rook and the White Pawn attack the square. The Pawn will promote to a Queen or Rook, giving mate.)

---

### Frame 95

In the following positions, White threatens the Black back rank, but *cannot* mate. You must decide why Black escapes the mate: Has he enough power to defend against White's attack? Or, will he have a flight square or a useful interposition?

![Diagram](images/page_132_1_4838.png)

Why does White's threat against Black's back rank *not* lead to mate?

☐ White does not have enough power to mate.

☐ The Black King will have a flight square.

☐ Black has a useful interposition.

---

### Frame 95 - Answer

The Black King will have a flight square.

(The White Queen will no longer guard it.)

---

### Frame 96

![Diagram](images/page_133_1_4836.png)

![Diagram](images/page_133_1_4836.png)

Why does White's threat against Black's back rank *not* lead to mate?

☐ White does not have enough power to mate.

☐ The Black King will have a flight square.

☐ Black has a useful interposition.

---

### Frame 96 - Answer

Black has a useful interposition.

(The Bishop interposes. Black could also play Rook-takes-Rook, Pawn-takes-Rook becoming a Queen with check, and then interpose; but this doesn't make much sense because White would gain a new Queen.)

---

### Frame 97

![Diagram](images/page_134_1_4834.png)

Why does White's threat against Black's back rank *not* lead to mate?

☐ White does not have enough power to mate.

☐ The Black King will have a flight square.

☐ Black has a useful interposition.

---

### Frame 97 - Answer

White does not have enough power to mate.

(Black Queen *and Bishop* guard the square on the back rank.)

---

### Frame 98

![Diagram](images/page_135_1_4832.png)

Why does White's threat against Black's back rank *not* lead to mate?

☐ White does not have enough power to mate.

☐ The Black King will have a flight square.

☐ Black has a useful interposition.

---

### Frame 98 - Answer

The Black King will have a flight square.

---

### Frame 99

In this position, focus your attention on the White and Black Queens:

![Diagram](images/page_136_1_4830.png)

Now explain in your own words why White cannot mate.

---

### Frame 99 - Answer

The White Queen is pinned.

(If the White Rook checks, Black's Rook simply captures, and the White Queen cannot recapture the Rook.)

---

### Frame 100

Here is a position from one of my games (Fischer vs. Bisguier, New York, 1957), where I (White) had to decide whether or not I should capture Bisguier's (Black) Queen with my Rook.

![Diagram](images/page_137_1_4828.png)

Would you capture Black's Queen?

☐ yes

☐ no

Explain your answer.

---

### Frame 100 - Answer

no

Black would recapture with his Rook, giving check and forcing mate. White then has only useless interpositions.

(Bisguier is a former U.S. Champion. I made a different move&mdash;Rook four squares to the left&mdash;and won the game.)

---

### Frame 101

![Diagram](images/page_138_1_4826.png)

To which square should the White Queen move to begin its mating combination?

☐ A

☐ B

☐ C

---

### Frame 101 - Answer

B

(Of course&mdash;the other two checks allow Black to capture White's Queen.)

---

### Frame 102

![Diagram](images/page_139_1_4824.png)

To which square should White move in this position?

☐ A

☐ B

☐ C

---

### Frame 102 - Answer

C

(The other moves would allow Black to escape mate.)

---

### Frame 103

Draw an arrow showing the first move of White's mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_140_1_4822.png)

---

### Frame 103 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_141_1_4819.png)

(After Black captures White's Rook, White will recapture with the Pawn making a Queen or Rook.)

---

### Frame 104

![Diagram](images/page_141_2_4820.png)

Should White check with the Rook or the Queen?

☐ with the Rook

☐ with the Queen

---

### Frame 104 - Answer

with the Queen

(The Queen checkmates. If White's Rook checks, the Black Knight can interpose on the square protected by Black's Queen; there is no mate then because the Black Bishop prevents the White Queen from checking.)

---

### Frame 105

Assume that White elects to check in this position; then decide whether he will be able to force mate.

![Diagram](images/page_142_1_4817.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with a back-rank check?

☐ yes

☐ no

If "no," why?

☐ not enough power

☐ flight square for Black King

☐ useful interposition

---

### Frame 105 - Answer

yes

(White mates. Interposition is useless.)

---

### Frame 106

![Diagram](images/page_143_1_4815.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with a back-rank check?

☐ yes

☐ no

If "no," why?

☐ not enough power

☐ flight squares for Black King

☐ useful interposition

---

### Frame 106 - Answer

yes

(White mates. Rook and Queen give him enough power.)

---

### Frame 107

![Diagram](images/page_144_1_4813.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with a back-rank check?

☐ yes

☐ no

If "no," why?

☐ not enough power

☐ flight square for Black King

☐ useful interposition

---

### Frame 107 - Answer

no

flight square for Black King

NOTE: Here's why it doesn't work. After White "queens" his Pawn&mdash;thereby giving check&mdash;Black captures the new Queen with his Rook. White then captures the Black Rook with his Rook, giving this position:

![Diagram](images/page_145_1_4810.png)

---

### Frame 108

![Diagram](images/page_145_2_4811.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with a back-rank check?

☐ yes

☐ no

If "no," why?

☐ not enough power

☐ flight square for Black King

☐ useful interposition

---

### Frame 108 - Answer

not enough power

(An example of two against two: Black's Bishop and Knight guard the checking square against the two attacking White Rooks.)

---

### Frame 109

![Diagram](images/page_146_1_4808.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with a back-rank check?

☐ yes

☐ no

If "no," why?

☐ not enough power

☐ flight square for Black King

☐ useful interposition

---

### Frame 109 - Answer

no

useful interposition (Bishop)

---

### Frame 110

![Diagram](images/page_147_1_4806.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with a back-rank check?

☐ yes

☐ no

If "no," why?

☐ not enough power

☐ flight square for Black King

☐ useful interposition

---

### Frame 110 - Answer

yes

(White mates. The second Rook delivers mate, supported by the Knight.)

![Diagram](images/page_148_1_4803.png)

---

### Frame 111

In this next series of frames, you will have to consider several positions. In some, White has a back-rank combination. In others, he has a one-move mate of a different type. In a few, he has no mate at all. Most of these positions are difficult, posing many possibilities. Observe all of the pieces on the board for Black defenses. *If the back-rank check does not lead to mate, look for other checks that might do so.*

![Diagram](images/page_148_2_4804.png)

In this position, White:

☐ can mate

☐ cannot mate

If there is a mate, draw an arrow to show White's key first move.

---

### Frame 111 - Answer

can mate

![Diagram](images/page_149_1_4800.png)

(White makes a Queen with his Pawn, giving check. If Black captures the Queen with his Rook, White will recapture with the White Rook, giving mate.)

---

### Frame 112

![Diagram](images/page_149_2_4801.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate

☐ White cannot mate

If there is a mate, show it (that is, the key first move).

In this position:

☐ White can mate

☐ White cannot mate

If there is a mate, show it.

---

### Frame 113 - Answer

White cannot mate

(If the White Queen checks on Black's back rank, the Bishop will interpose. Or, if the Queen checks four squares straight ahead, Black can flee.)

---

## Page 163

SUMMARY

The Back-Rank Mates

In this chapter you were introduced to the elements of the back-rank mate and the three methods of escaping check (and mate): capturing the checking piece, interposing and fleeing.

Here is an example of the back-rank mating theme. The following position came up in my game with Raymond Weinstein (Black) in the 1960 United States Championship (Black to move):

Weinstein
![Diagram](images/page_163_1_5390.png)
Fischer

I had just captured a Pawn with my Queen. The obvious question was, why couldn't Black capture the Queen with his Rook? Well, if the Rook had captured the Queen, I would have played Rook-check; the Knight would have to take the Rook; and then Rook-takesKnight would have been mate! The Black Rook could not leave the back rank.

Note also that my Queen was attacking Black's Rook, on the back rank, and Black's Bishop. If Black had attempted to "protect" his Bishop with the attacked Rook, I would simply have played Queen-takes-Bishop! Ray, realizing he was "busted," resigned.

Here is another example from my 1960 United States Championship game with Herbert Seidman (Black):

Seidman
![Diagram](images/page_164_1_5388.png)
Fischer

It's my move and I have to be careful not to think my King is safe. If, for instance, I dare to capture the Black Pawn as shown by arrow 1, Black would mate with his Rook (see arrow 2). Fleeing, as shown by arrow 3, is not possible&mdash;the other Rook covers that square!

---

# Chapter 3: BACK-RANK DEFENSES AND VARIATIONS

Now that you have the basic idea of the back-rank mates, you are ready to explore the subtleties of this theme. In this chapter and the chapters that follow, I wili present mating variations and defenses in rapid succession.

---

### Frame 125

Observe the combination below:

![Diagram](images/page_166_1_4760.png)

A. White's two Rooks are ready to give check on the same back-rank square, but Black has two defenders. White must get rid of one of these defenders before he can mate.

![Diagram](images/page_166_2_4761.png)

B. White plays Queen-takes-Rook, giving check.

![Diagram](images/page_166_3_4762.png)

C. Black's remaining Rook must recapture.

![Diagram](images/page_166_4_4763.png)

D. Now there are two White Rooks against only one back-rank defender. White moves Rook to Black's back rank, giving check, and mates on the next move.

---

### Frame 126

In this position White can begin a back-rank mating combination by first removing one of the Black defenders.

Draw an arrow to show the first move in White's mating sequence:

![Diagram](images/page_167_1_4758.png)

---

### Frame 126 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_168_1_4755.png)

(When Black recaptures with Rook, White's Queen and Rook have enough power to mate.)

---

### Frame 127

Again, draw an arrow to show the first move of White's mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_168_2_4756.png)

---

### Frame 127 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_169_1_4752.png)

(When Black plays Rook-takes-Queen, the White Rook check leads to mate.)

---

### Frame 128


Here is a position where White can remove one of Black's back-rank defenders, but it does him no good. If Black recaptures with the right piece, it will still be two against two.

![Diagram](images/page_169_2_4753.png)

If White plays Rook-takes-Rook-check (as shown), how can Black save himself?

☐ by playing *Rook*-takes-Rook

☐ by playing *Queen*-takes-Rook

---

### Frame 128 - Answer

by playing *Queen*-takes-Rook

(So it will still be two against two.)

---

### Frame 129

![Diagram](images/page_170_1_4750.png)

In this position, does a White move of Queen-takes-Rook-check (as shown) lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 129 - Answer

no

(Black's Queen recaptures and maintains guard on the back rank.)

---

### Frame 130

![Diagram](images/page_171_1_4748.png)

If White plays Queen-takes-Queen (as shown), how should Black recapture?

☐ with the Bishop

☐ with the Rook

---

### Frame 130 - Answer

with the Rook

(The Rook guards the back rank. Recapture with the Bishop would enable White's Rook to mate.)

---

### Frame 131

White has a mating combination, but he must make the key first move. He has several possibilities.

Draw an arrow to show his correct choice:

![Diagram](images/page_172_1_4746.png)

---

### Frame 131 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_173_1_5049.png)

(The correct move, as shown, reduces the number of Black's back-rank defenders from two to one. Then White's Rook can check on the back rank supported by the Pawn. Black must recapture the checking Rook and when White recaptures with the Pawn he makes a new Queen or Rook, giving mate. But not White's Queen takes the *other* Rook, since Black's *Queen* can capture and replace the Rook as a guard of the back rank.)

---

### Frame 132

![Diagram](images/page_173_2_5050.png)

Does a White move of Queen-captures-Rook lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 132 - Answer

no

(On Queen-takes-Rook-check, Black's Queen can recapture and guard the back rank.)

---

### Frame 133

![Diagram](images/page_174_1_5047.png)

Does White Rook-takes-Black Rook-check lead to mate in this position?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 133 - Answer

yes

(White will play Queen-check on Black's back rank after Black recaptures.)

---

### Frame 134

Here's a hard one:

![Diagram](images/page_175_1_5045.png)

If White plays Rook-takes-Rook-check, can he mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 134 - Answer

yes!

(The mate is finally delivered *by the White Queen*. Work it out.)

---

### Frame 135

Sometimes, you have the choice of making a straight back-rank check or of capturing a defender.

Observe the position below; then, draw an arrow to show the key first move in White's mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_176_1_5043.png)

---

### Frame 135 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_177_1_5040.png)

(White can mate by checking directly on the back rank because White's Pawn is supporting the White Queen's checking square. When Black captures White's Queen with his Rook, White can play either Rook-takes-Rook-check or Pawn-takes-Rook \[becoming a Queen\] -check, and will mate on the next move. Not Queen-takes-Rookcheck, which reduces White's power and maintains Black's after Black recaptures with his Rook.)

---

### Frame 136

Again, draw an arrow to show White's key first move:

![Diagram](images/page_177_2_5041.png)

---

### Frame 136 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_178_1_5036.png)

(This capture enables White to reduce Black's power from two to one. White then checks with his Rook, Black captures with his Queen, and White recaptures the Queen with his Pawn, making a Queen or Rook and mating.)

---

### Frame 137

Here is a variation on the theme you have just learned.

Observe how White mates:

![Diagram](images/page_178_2_5037.png)

A. White plays Queen-takes-Rook-check. Black's King must recapture.

![Diagram](images/page_178_3_5038.png)

B. The Black King has captured White's Queen. And now White's Rook, protected by the Bishop, can mate.

---

### Frame 138

In this and the next few positions, a White sacrifice of Queen-takes-Rook does *not* lead to mate. You must decide why this is so.

![Diagram](images/page_179_1_5034.png)

Why does the White move of Queen-takes-Rook-check not lead to mate?

☐ White does not have enough power.

☐ At the end of White's combination, Black has a useful interposition.

☐ At the end of White's combination, Black has a flight square.

---

### Frame 138 - Answer

White does not have enough power.

(After King-takes-Queen, Black will have Queen and King against two Rooks or two against two, stopping the back-rank mate.)

---

### Frame 139

![Diagram](images/page_180_1_5032.png)

Why does the White move of Queen-takes-Rook-check not lead to mate?

☐ White does not have enough power.

☐ At the end of White's combination, Black has a useful interposition.

☐ At the end of White's combination, Black has a flight square.

---

### Frame 139 - Answer

At the end of White's combination, Black has a flight square.

---

### Frame 140

This one might seem tricky!

![Diagram](images/page_181_1_5030.png)

Why does the White move of Queen-takes-Rook-check not lead to mate?

☐ White does not have enough power.

☐ At the end of White's combination, Black has a useful interposition.

☐ At the end of White's combination, Black has a flight square.

---

### Frame 140 - Answer

At the end of White's combination, Black has a useful interposition.

(The Knight capture will uncover the Black Bishop.)

---

### Frame 141

![Diagram](images/page_182_1_5028.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with Rook-takes-Rock-check?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 141 - Answer

yes

(After King-takes-Rook, White mates with his remaining Rook on the back rank.)

---

### Frame 142

Before we discuss other mating variations, let's look at some problems for the defender. 

![Diagram](images/page_183_1_5026.png)

White is threatening to play Rook-takes-Rook, followed by mate. It's Black's move. Surprisingly enough, he has only one good defense:

☐ Rook takes Rook, as shown

☐ Pawn advances one or two squares, as shown

---

### Frame 142 - Answer

Pawn advances one or two squares, as shown

(If Black plays Rook-takes-Rook, he gets mated. Or if Black moves his unpinned Rook one square, for example, White plays Rook-takes-Rook-check and mates with the other Rook. Advancing the Pawn to create a fleeing square is Black's only defense.)

---

### Frame 143

![Diagram](images/page_184_1_5024.png)

Suppose that White plays Queen-takes-Rook-check (as shown).

Black's only saving move is to recapture with:

☐ his King

☐ his Rook

---

### Frame 143 - Answer

his Rook

(Black would be mated if he captured with his King: the White Rook checks, Rook-takes-Rook, Rook-takes-Rook-mate.)

---

### Frame 144

Here is one of the most critical of all the back-rank defenses. The following positions will show you the idea:

![Diagram](images/page_185_1_5022.png)

A. Surprisingly enough, in this position White cannot mate, *no matter which Rook he takes*. Even though they seem disconnected, the Rooks protect each other!

![Diagram](images/page_185_2_5455.png)

B. But in this position, if it is White's move, he has an easy mate. 

![Diagram](images/page_186_1_5020.png)

C. Then how does Black defend in positions such as this one? He cannot play Rook-takes-Queen, but *he can play Rook-interposes* (as shown).

---

### Frame 145

Draw an arrow to show how Black saves himself from checkmate:

![Diagram](images/page_187_1_5018.png)

---

### Frame 145 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_188_1_5015.png)

(The only defense.)

---

### Frame 146

Draw an arrow to show Black's correct defense:

![Diagram](images/page_188_2_5016.png)

---

### Frame 146 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_189_1_5012.png)

(Capture by the other Rook would leave one defender of the back rank to two attackers.)

---

### Frame 147

Draw the usual arrow to show Black's saving shot:

![Diagram](images/page_189_2_5013.png)

---

### Frame 147 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_190_1_5009.png)

---

### Frame 148

This one is a little different. Draw an arrow to show Black's correct defense:

![Diagram](images/page_190_2_5010.png)

---

### Frame 148 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_191_1_5006.png)

(The Rook capture protects the back rank.)

---

### Frame 149

Draw an arrow to show Black's defense:

![Diagram](images/page_191_2_5007.png)

---

### Frame 149 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_192_1_5003.png)

(The King capture would lead to mate after Rook checks.)

---

### Frame 150

Draw an arrow to show Black's saving defense:

![Diagram](images/page_192_2_5004.png)

---

### Frame 150 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_193_2_5459.png)

---

### Frame 151

Now you will be asked to decide whether or not White has one of the back-rank mating combinations you have learned.

![Diagram](images/page_193_1_5001.png)

Can White force mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

If he can, draw an arrow to show his key first move.

---

### Frame 151 - Answer

yes

![Diagram](images/page_194_2_5457.png)

(The Queen sacrifice will be followed by Rook mate on Black's back rank.)

---

### Frame 152

![Diagram](images/page_194_1_4999.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate

☐ White can't mate

If he can, show his key first move.

---

### Frame 152 - Answer

White can't mate

(After the Queen check, *Black's Queen interposes*.)

---

### Frame 153

![Diagram](images/page_195_1_5461.png)

Can White mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

If he can, show his key first move.

---

### Frame 153 - Answer

yes

![Diagram](images/page_196_1_4996.png)

(It's three against two.)

---

### Frame 154

![Diagram](images/page_196_2_4997.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate

☐ White can't mate

If he can mate, show his key first move.

---

### Frame 154 - Answer

White can mate

(White reduces Black's back rank defenders, thereby giving himself enough power to mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_197_1_4993.png)

(The Black Rook will recapture. White will then reply with a Queen check on the back rank.)

---

### Frame 155

![Diagram](images/page_197_2_4994.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate

☐ White can't mate

If he can mate, show his key first move.

---

### Frame 155 - Answer

White can't mate

(After White's Queen-takes-Rook-check, Black can defend by playing Queen-takes-Queen. If White tries Queen-takes-Queen, Black must capture with the Rook at the lower left&mdash;if Black captures with the Rook next to his King, White will have enough power to mate.)

---

### Frame 156

![Diagram](images/page_198_1_4991.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate

☐ White can't mate

If he can mate, show his key first move.

---

### Frame 156 - Answer

White can mate

![Diagram](images/page_199_1_4988.png)

(... followed by Rook mates.)

---

### Frame 157

![Diagram](images/page_199_2_4989.png)

In this position:

☐ White can mate

☐ White can't mate

If he can mate, show his key first move.

---

### Frame 157 - Answer

White can't mate

---

### Frame 158

Here's a back-rank mate sideways!

Draw an arrow showing how White mates:

![Diagram](images/page_200_1_4986.png)

---

### Frame 158 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_201_1_4984.png)

NOTE: This is taken from my game with Reshevsky (Black), played in New York, 1962. My opponent has won the United States Championship several times. (Actually, I missed this &mdash;but I won anyway!)

SUMMARY

Back-Rank Defenses and Variations

In this chapter you were presented not only with more difficult mating combinations, but also with more intricate defenses. You were taught that in some situations power does not work directly, but is effective only if the combination is preceded by a move that eliminates a back-rank defender. You have strengthened your defensive understanding on several points including disconnected Rooks and safe recaptures.

Also, you should be aware of back-rank mating situations *not* on the back rank, but sideways. As another example, consider the following position which arose in my game with Pilnik (Black) in 1959:

![Diagram](images/page_202_1_5386.png)

White mates by playing Queen-takes-Knight-check. The King then takes Queen, Rook moves one square to the right, giving mate!

---

# Chapter 4: DISPLACING DEFENDERS

Sometimes a key defensive piece will hinder your attempt to force checkmate. In such situations you may be able to mate after driving that piece away.

---

### Frame 159

![Diagram](images/page_204_1_4979.png)

A. Here White has a simple mate. It may be difficult to see at first, since the Black Bishop can capture whichever White Rook checks. Follow the moves for both sides as shown.

![Diagram](images/page_204_2_4980.png)

B. First the Rook on the left moves down, sacrificing itself. Black's Bishop must capture. (The interposition is useless.)

![Diagram](images/page_204_3_4981.png)

C. The Black Bishop has captured, and now White's remaining Rook can mate. The idea behind this play is to draw the Black Bishop away from the position from which it guards the key square.

![Diagram](images/page_204_4_4982.png)

D. Here's what happens if White incorrectly checks first with his other Rook: Now on move two, Rook down threatens mate, but it is not check&mdash;so Black has time to defend. As a matter of fact, here he has a very good "defense" by mating White as shown.

---

### Frame 160

![Diagram](images/page_205_1_4977.png)

Which move should White make to begin a mating combination here?

☐ move A

☐ move B

---

### Frame 160 - Answer

move A

(And the remaining Rook will deliver the mate after the Knight captures.)

---

### Frame 161

![Diagram](images/page_206_1_4975.png)

Suppose the White Rook checks as shown. Black could only save himself by capturing with his:

☐ Bishop

☐ Knight

---

### Frame 161 - Answer

Bishop

(Black must not allow his Knight to be drawn away.)

---

### Frame 162

A similar theme. Draw an arrow to show the first move in White's mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_207_1_4973.png)

---

### Frame 162 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_208_1_4970.png)

(The Black Bishop recapture will allow checkmate by the remaining Rook.)

---

### Frame 163

In this next series of frames you will be asked to decide whether White can mate by first drawing away a Black piece.

![Diagram](images/page_208_2_4971.png)

Can White mate by first drawing away Black's Queen?

☐ yes

☐ no

If he can, draw an arrow to show White's first move.

---

### Frame 163 - Answer

no

(It won't work in positions like this because the Queen will still protect the back rank.)

![Diagram](images/page_209_1_4967.png)

(After White tries Queen check on the back rank, Black plays Queen-takes-Queen.)

---

### Frame 164

![Diagram](images/page_209_2_4968.png)

Can White mate by first drawing away a Black defender?

☐ yes

☐ no

If he can, draw an arrow to show White's key first move.

---

### Frame 164 - Answer

no

(Even if Black's Knight is drawn away, Black's Bishop holds the position.)

---

### Frame 165

![Diagram](images/page_210_1_4965.png)

Can White mate by first drawing away a Black defender?

☐ yes

☐ no

If he can, draw an arrow to show his key first move.

---

### Frame 165 - Answer

yes

(First the Knight is drawn away, allowing White's Rook to check; then the Bishop interposition is useless.)

![Diagram](images/page_211_1_4962.png)

---

### Frame 166

![Diagram](images/page_211_2_4963.png)

Can White mate here?

☐ yes

☐ no

If he can, draw an arrow to show White's key first move.

---

### Frame 166 - Answer

yes

![Diagram](images/page_212_1_4959.png)

(The Knight recapture will uncover the checking square for White's remaining Rook. If, instead, the Knight interposes, Rook-takes-Knight will be mate.)

---

### Frame 167

![Diagram](images/page_212_2_4960.png)

Can White mate by first drawing away a Black defender?

☐ yes

☐ no

If he can, draw an arrow to show his key first move.

---

### Frame 167 - Answer

no

(If the White Queen attempts to displace the Black Knight, it will do no good. Black's King has a flight square.)

---

### Frame 168

Here is a variation on the theme of driving away your opponent's King from a key defensive square.

![Diagram](images/page_213_1_4956.png)

A. White's Queen and Rook cannot mate directly on the back rank because Black has two defenders, the Rook and King. His idea is to drive the King away first, so that it will no longer defend.

![Diagram](images/page_213_2_4957.png)

B. The White Queen therefore checks, as shown. The Black King must move away toward the corner.

![Diagram](images/page_214_1_4954.png)

C. And now White has a simple back-rank mate.

---

### Frame 169

![Diagram](images/page_215_1_4952.png)

Can White mate if he first checks (as shown) in this position?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 169 - Answer

no

(Driving away the King does not work. Black's King is forced away but will have an escape square.)

---

### Frame 170

![Diagram](images/page_216_1_5084.png)

If the White Queen checks (as shown), will White be able to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 170 - Answer

no

(Not if Black's *Bishop* captures. If the Black King moves, White mates.)

---

### Frame 171

There are many ways of driving away the Black King. Here are some examples:

![Diagram](images/page_217_1_5081.png)

A1. White plays Knight check (as shown).

![Diagram](images/page_217_2_5082.png)

A2. The Black King has been driven into the corner. White can now play Rook-takes-Rook-mate.

![Diagram](images/page_218_1_5076.png)

B1. White's Rook has checked. Black must interpose his Rook.

![Diagram](images/page_218_2_5077.png)

B2. And now the White Bishop checks. Black's King must move into the corner (his Rook is pinned and cannot interpose). White will then play Rook-takes-Rook-mate.

![Diagram](images/page_218_3_5078.png)

C1. The White Queen has checked. Black's Queen must interpose.

![Diagram](images/page_218_4_5079.png)

C2. White plays Bishop-takes-Pawn-check. What is Black to do? His Queen cannot capture (its pinned), nor can his King. He must move his King into the corner and be mated.

![Diagram](images/page_219_1_5071.png)

D1. Here the White *Rook* checks.

![Diagram](images/page_219_2_5072.png)

D2. Black has only one move: the King must move into the corner, allowing White to play Queen-takes-Queen-mate.

![Diagram](images/page_219_3_5073.png)

E1. Even a lowly Pawn sometimes gets into the act. In this position, White plays Pawn-takes-Pawn-check.

![Diagram](images/page_219_4_5074.png)

E2. Observe the position now. The checking White Pawn is protected by a Knight. Black's King can only move away and be mated by Queen-takes-Queen.

---

### Frame 172

Draw an arrow to show the correct move for White:

![Diagram](images/page_220_1_5069.png)

---

### Frame 172 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_221_1_5066.png)

(... driving the King into the corner to allow Rook-takes-Rook-mate.)

---

### Frame 173

Again, draw an arrow to show the correct move for White:

![Diagram](images/page_221_2_5067.png)

---

### Frame 173 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_222_1_5064.png)

(... followed by Queen-takes-Queen-mate.)

---

### Frame 174

Let's look at some simple defenses against displacing attempts.

![Diagram](images/page_222_2_5463.png)

a. How does Black defend against the check by White's Bishop (as shown at square A)?

b. How does Black defend against the White's Queen check, as shown?

---

### Frame 174 - Answer

a. Black Pawn pushes and interposes.

b. Black Queen takes White Queen.

---

### Frame 175

In this position, White has various tries, but only one move works.

![Diagram](images/page_223_1_5062.png)

What is the correct White move?

☐ Bishop to square A

☐ Queen to square B

---

### Frame 175 - Answer

Bishop to square A

(Queen-takes-Queen would be Black's reply to the White Queen check.)

---

### Frame 176

![Diagram](images/page_224_1_5060.png)

How should White's Queen move?

☐ to square A

☐ to square B

---

### Frame 176 - Answer

to square B

(Then White will mate on the back rank. From square A White would not have enough power to mate on the back rank.)

---

### Frame 177

Here White could try to displace *either* the King *or* another defender. Draw an arrow to show his correct move:

![Diagram](images/page_225_1_5058.png)

---

### Frame 177 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_226_1_5055.png)

(Queen-check would lose to Bishop-takes-Queen.)

---

### Frame 178

Draw an arrow to show the correct displacing move:

![Diagram](images/page_226_2_5056.png)

---

### Frame 178 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_227_1_5053.png)

(Black must move his King into the corner; then White mates by playing Queen-takes-Queen.)

---

### Frame 179

Draw an arrow to show the winning move for White:

![Diagram](images/page_227_2_5243.png)

---

### Frame 179 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_228_1_5240.png)

(The White Queen can't drive away the Black King because the Black Queen guards the important square.)

---

### Frame 180

Unless you look closely at this one, you won't see all of White's attempts and you'll miss the winning move.

Draw an arrow to show the move for White that leads to mate:

![Diagram](images/page_228_2_5241.png)

---

### Frame 180 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_229_1_5236.png)

(Here White can reach the same mating position in two ways: (1) Bishop-takes-Pawn-check; King one square to the left; Queen to the back rank, check; Rook-takes-Queen, Rook-takes-Rook-mate. (2) Queen to back rank, check; Rook-takes-Queen; Bishop-takes-Pawn-check; King one square to the left; Rook-takes-Rookmate. Incidentally, the Bishop check at square X permits Black to interpose with his Pawn at square Y.)

---

### Frame 181

One more subtlety of the displacing themes.

![Diagram](images/page_229_2_5237.png)

A. Observe this position. It looks harmless enough. But, White can force mate.

![Diagram](images/page_229_3_5238.png)

B. First move in the combination: Knight checks as shown.

![Diagram](images/page_230_1_5233.png)

C. If Black allows his King to be driven into the corner, his Queen will be left unprotected. His only other move is Pawncaptures-Knight.

![Diagram](images/page_230_2_5234.png)

D. And now the idea becomes clear! We have here an example of the driving away theme. The White Rook checks (and after Black's King moves, White's Queen will mate).

---

### Frame 182

![Diagram](images/page_231_1_5231.png)

White's Knight has checked. Black can save himself by playing:

☐ King moves

☐ Pawn captures

☐ Knight captures

---

### Frame 182 - Answer

Knight captures

![Diagram](images/page_232_1_5228.png)

(If Pawn captures, the White Rook check on the newly opened line will drive the King into the corner \[see diagram\], and the other Rook will mate. If the King moves, then Rook captures Bishop, giving mate.)

---

### Frame 183

![Diagram](images/page_232_2_5229.png)

Does a check by White's Knight at square A lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

Does a check by White's Knight at square B lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 183 - Answer

yes

yes

(In either case, Black's Pawn must capture. White's Queen can then drive the Black King into the corner.)

---

### Frame 184

Here White attempts to drive away the Black King, beginning with Knight checks. Decide whether the move succeeds.

![Diagram](images/page_233_1_5465.png)

Does the White Knight's check (as shown) lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 184 - Answer

no! 

![Diagram](images/page_234_1_5225.png)

(Black plays Pawn-takes-Knight; then after White's Rook checks, Black's Rook interposes, protected by a Pawn. If the Knight checks on the other square, the same kind of situation results.)

---

### Frame 185

![Diagram](images/page_234_2_5226.png)

Does the White Knight check work here?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 185 - Answer

yes

(The White Queen will be able to drive the Black King into the corner if Black captures the Knight. The White Rook will be the mating piece.)

---

### Frame 186

REVIEW

White can mate in all of the positions shown in this next series of frames. Sometimes he does so in one move, sometimes by a back-rank combination, sometimes by a move that displaces the enemy King or an enemy piece.

Draw an arrow to show the correct move for White in his mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_235_1_5223.png)

---

### Frame 186 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_236_1_5220.png)

(The Bishop check will not work because Black's Knight can interpose at square X, thereby stopping all mates.)

---

### Frame 187

Draw an arrow to show the first move for White in his mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_236_2_5221.png)

---

### Frame 187 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_237_1_5217.png)

(White forces the Black King into the corner, thereby giving himself enough power to mate.)

(And White mates with his Rook on the next move.)

---

### Frame 189

Draw an arrow to show the first move for White in his mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_238_2_5215.png)

---

### Frame 189 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_239_1_5211.png)

(If the Pawn captures the Knight, a safe White Queen check will *force* the Black King into the corner, and then Rook-takes-Rook will be mate. If the King moves into the corner immediately, Rook-takes-Rook is mate.)

---

### Frame 190

Draw an arrow to show the first move for White in his mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_239_2_5212.png)

(The Black Bishop captures the Rook; then the remaining White Rook will mate.)

---

### Frame 192

Draw an arrow to show the first move for White in his mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_241_2_5206.png)

---

### Frame 192 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_242_1_5202.png)

(After taking the Pawn, the White Bishop is safe from capture by either the Black King or Rook. Black's King must therefore move into the corner. Then Rook-takes-Rook is mate.)

---

## Frame 193

## Page 245

SUMMARY

Displacing Defenders

Here is an example of mating by driving the King into the corner. From my game with Herbert Seidman (White) in the 1957 United States Championship:

![Diagram](images/page_245_1_5383.png)

White would like to capture my Bishop and be ahead in material by two Pawns. Let's see what would happen. Suppose White plays Rook-takes-Bishop. I then play Rook-takes-Rook and White recaptures with his Queen, giving this position:

![Diagram](images/page_245_2_5384.png)

Now I (Black) can play Queen-takes-Pawn-check, driving the King into the corner. Then it's a simple mate after the Queen checks on White's back rank.

---

# Chapter 5: ATTACKS ON THE ENEMY PAWN

Sometimes your opponent's King appears completely secure with his own pieces surrounding him on all sides, when in fact he can easily be mated by a sacrifice that breaks up his defense. All of the themes in this chapter involve sacrifices that demolish the Pawn structure in front of the enemy King.

---

### Frame 195

Observe how mate is accomplished in the diagrams below:

![Diagram](images/page_247_1_5192.png)

A. In this position, White has a simple mate in two moves but he must find the key first move. All other moves lose the game for him.

![Diagram](images/page_247_2_5193.png)

B. White's key first move: Queen-captures-Pawn-check, sacrificing his Queen.

![Diagram](images/page_247_3_5194.png)

C. Black's Rook captures the Queen. (Note that the Black King could *not* capture because of White's Bishop.)

![Diagram](images/page_247_4_5195.png)

D. The check by White's Rook does it! Black's Rook cannot interpose (it's pinned).

---

### Frame 196

Let's look at this position again:

![Diagram](images/page_248_1_5189.png)

A. White's Queen has captured the Pawn with check. Black decides to move his King.

![Diagram](images/page_248_2_5190.png)

B. Now White can play Queen-takes-Rook-mate.

---

### Frame 197

In the next four positions, you will have to determine whether a sacrifice similar to the one that you've just seen will lead to mate.

![Diagram](images/page_249_1_5187.png)

Does the White move of Queen-takes-Pawn-check (as shown) lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 197 - Answer

no 

(Black's King or Rook can safely take the Queen. An important element of the theme&mdash;the White Bishop&mdash;is missing.)

---

### Frame 198

![Diagram](images/page_250_1_5185.png)

Does Queen-takes-Pawn-check lead to mate here?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 198 - Answer

yes

(Here the Bishop is present. When Black plays Rook-takes-Queen, the White Rook will mate.)

---

### Frame 199

![Diagram](images/page_251_1_5183.png)

Does the White move of Queen-takes-Pawn-check (as shown) lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 199 - Answer

yes

(A mate for White! If Black plays Queen-takes-Queen, then the White Rook mates.)

---

### Frame 200

![Diagram](images/page_252_1_5181.png)

Does the White move of Queen-takes-Pawn-check (as shown) lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 200 - Answer

no

(White does not mate since Black's King has a flight square. Black should play Rook-takes-Queen and then flee with his King when White checks with his Rook.)

---

### Frame 201

![Diagram](images/page_253_1_5179.png)

Does the White move of Queen-takes-Pawn-check (as shown) lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 201 - Answer

yes

(The sacrifice works&mdash;White mates.)

---

### Frame 202

Here are some positions where the theme you have learned does not apply. In each case, you will be asked to explain why this is so.

![Diagram](images/page_254_1_5177.png)

A White move of Queen-takes-Pawn-check does not lead to mate because ...

---

### Frame 202 - Answer

Black's Bishop will be able to interpose

(After Black plays Queen-takes-Queen, White Rook checks and Black saves himself as above.)

---

### Frame 203

![Diagram](images/page_255_1_5175.png)

A White move of Queen-takes-Pawn-check does not lead to mate because ...

---

### Frame 203 - Answer

Black's Knight captures the Queen

(Otherwise, Black will be mated.)

---

### Frame 204

![Diagram](images/page_256_1_5173.png)

A White move of Queen-takes-Pawn-check does not lead to mate because ...

---

### Frame 204 - Answer

White's Rook will not be able to check

(It is pinned.)

---

### Frame 205


From a game of mine. If you were Black what would you play here? Think!

Black has two threats-one is obvious, but the other ...

Draw an arrow showing Black's best move.

![Diagram](images/page_257_1_5171.png)

---

### Frame 205 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_258_1_5167.png)

NOTE: Queen-takes-Pawn-check leads to mate. This position is from my 1959 game with the Swiss Master, Bhend. I was White *but* it was actually my move&mdash;not Black's! Moving the Rook three squares horizontally&mdash;between the Black Queen. and Rook&mdash;stops both threats.

---

### Frame 206

In this position, White combines the theme of attack against the Pawn near the King with one of the displacing themes.

![Diagram](images/page_258_2_5168.png)

A. White starts by giving up his Queen: Queen-takes-Pawncheck.

![Diagram](images/page_258_3_5169.png)

B. The White Queen has made its check, and Black's Rook will capture (note that White's Knight prevents Black's King from capturing).

![Diagram](images/page_259_1_5164.png)

C. White's Rook checks, but this time Black's Rook can interpose.

![Diagram](images/page_259_2_5165.png)

D. But now the White Bishop can drive away Black's King. You've seen this part of the combination before. White mates.

---

### Frame 207

You must be certain all of the elements in the combination are present. Otherwise, you'll simply throw away your Queen.

![Diagram](images/page_260_1_5162.png)

Here is a position where the White Queen has sacrificed (as shown). It looks as if the sacrifice will work, but it doesn't. Black saves himself by capturing the Queen with his ...

---

### Frame 207 - Answer

King!

(Capture by the Black Rook loses.)

---

### Frame 208

See how the sacrifice fails miserably in this position:

![Diagram](images/page_261_1_5159.png)

A. Here goes the White Queen ...

![Diagram](images/page_261_2_5160.png)

B. The White Queen has captured the Pawn, with check.

![Diagram](images/page_262_1_5154.png)

C. Black's Rook has captured, allowing White's Rook to check.

![Diagram](images/page_262_2_5155.png)

D. White's Rook has checked; Black has a simple defense: Rook interposes. Black must resist the impulse to play Rook-takes-Rook first&mdash;that move would lose the game for him.

![Diagram](images/page_262_3_5156.png)

E. The White Bishop checks, driving the King into the corner. Everything has gone as planned ...

![Diagram](images/page_262_4_5157.png)

F. ... but wait a minute! What is White going to do now? Nothing. Black's back rank is sound. White cannot mate and has lost his Queen. But if Black had traded Rooks, White would now be able to play Rook-takes-Rook mate.

---

### Frame 209

Check the following position to see if all of the elements for the mating combination are present:

![Diagram](images/page_263_1_5152.png)

Does the Queen check (as shown) lead to mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 209 - Answer

yes

---

### Frame 210

![Diagram](images/page_264_1_5150.png)

Does the sacrifice work here?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 210 - Answer

yes

(White mates. After Black plays Rook-takes-Queen, White checks with his Rook on the back rank; Black interposes with his Rook; and then White checks with his Bishop&mdash;driving the Black King into the corner and making possible Rook-takes-Rook-mate.)

---

### Frame 211

You must have figured one of these positions would not be a mate. So on this one, I'll ask you something else.

![Diagram](images/page_265_1_5148.png)

After the Queen check, how can Black save himself?

☐ by moving his King away

☐ by playing Queen-takes-Queen

---

### Frame 211 - Answer

by moving his King away

(If, instead, he plays Queen-takes-Queen, White would mate with this line of play: White Rook checks; Rook-takes-Rook; Rook-takes-Rook-checkmate.)

---

### Frame 212

![Diagram](images/page_266_1_5145.png)

A. Here the White Queen has taken the Pawn, with check,  and Black's Rook captures.

![Diagram](images/page_266_2_5146.png)

B. White's Rook checks and Black's Rook must interpose.

![Diagram](images/page_267_1_5143.png)

C. Now look at the position. It's two against one and a back-rank mate. White can mate with either Rook.

---

### Frame 213

![Diagram](images/page_268_1_5467.png)

One other variation:

1. White's Queen takes Pawn, giving check (Black's Rook must capture).
2. White's Rook checks, etc.

What White piece actually delivers the mate?

---

### Frame 213 - Answer

the Bishop

---

### Frame 214

You have seen how, in certain positions, the key move Queen-takes-Pawn-check draws a defender from the back rank and leads to mate. In this series of frames, you will be asked to work out the whole combination and to circle the White piece that delivers the checkmate.

Assume, here, that Black captures the Queen.

![Diagram](images/page_269_1_5141.png)

---

### Frame 214 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_270_1_5138.png)

(After Queen-takes-Pawncheck, Rook-takes-Queen, Rook down leads to mate.)

---

### Frame 215

Circle the White piece that administers mate:

![Diagram](images/page_270_2_5139.png)

---

### Frame 215 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_271_1_5135.png)

(After Queen-takes-Pawn-check followed by Rook-takes-Queen, Rook \[in center\] checks, Rook interposes and Bishop gives mate.)

---

### Frame 216

Circle the White piece that administers mate:

![Diagram](images/page_271_2_5136.png)

---

### Frame 216 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_272_1_5132.png)

(This one is tricky&mdash;after Queen-takes-Pawn-check, Rook takes Queen, Rook interposes and White pushes up his Pawn, checkmate.)

---

### Frame 217

Circle the White piece that administers mate:

![Diagram](images/page_272_2_5133.png)

---

### Frame 217 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_273_1_5129.png)

(Here, after Queen-takes-Pawn-check, Rook takes Queen, Rook checks, Rook interposes \[other interpositions are useless\], and the Bishop next to the King moves up and mates on square X.)

---

### Frame 218

Circle the White piece that administers mate, assuming Black captures the Queen:

![Diagram](images/page_273_2_5130.png)

---

### Frame 218 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_274_1_5125.png)

(After Queen-takes-Pawn-check, Rook takes Queen, Rook checks, Rook interposes, the circled White Rook \[by now down on Black's back rank\] captures the Black Rook, giving checkmate. In the final position, the Rook giving mate is supported by the other White Rook.)

---

### Frame 219

![Diagram](images/page_274_2_5126.png)

A. Here the Queen sacrifice doesn't work, but ...

![Diagram](images/page_274_3_5127.png)

B. ... the Rook sacrifice does!

![Diagram](images/page_275_1_5123.png)

C. The Black King has been forced to capture. And now White's Queen mates. Notice that the King is hemmed in. The position is almost like a back-rank mate.

---

### Frame 220

Decide whether the type of sacrifice shown in the previous frame works in each of the five positions that follow.

![Diagram](images/page_276_1_5121.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with Queen-takes-Pawn-check (as shown)?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 220 - Answer

yes

(White mates: Queen-takes-Pawn-check; King-takes-Queen; Rook over to the right; checkmate.)

---

### Frame 221

![Diagram](images/page_277_1_5119.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with Queen-takes-Pawn (as shown)?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 221 - Answer

yes

(White mates. Here the White Knight keeps the Black King from fleeing.)

---

### Frame 222

![Diagram](images/page_278_1_5117.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with Queen-takes-Pawn-check (as shown)?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 222 - Answer

no

![Diagram](images/page_279_1_5114.png)

(The Black King will have a flight square.)

---

### Frame 223

![Diagram](images/page_279_2_5115.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with Queen-takes-Pawn (as shown)?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 223 - Answer

no!

(White does not mate. After White plays Queen-takes-Pawn-check, Black's King takes Queen and the Rook moves over to the left, giving check, Black can interpose with his Rook.)

---

### Frame 224

![Diagram](images/page_280_1_5112.png)

Does White have a mating combination beginning with Queen-takes-Pawn (as shown)?

☐ yes

☐ no

---

### Frame 224 - Answer

no

(*Not if Black replies with Queen-takes-Queen!* On King-takes-Queen, White would mate.)

---

### Frame 225

In some of the following positions, White utilizes the theme you have just learned in order to mate. In others, he mates in a different way.

Draw an arrow to show the first move in the White mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_281_1_5110.png)

---

### Frame 225 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_282_1_5107.png)

(Queen-takes-Pawn-check; Rook-takes-Queen; Rook down checks; Rook next to King interposes; Bishop checks; and mate next move by Rook-takes-Rook.)

---

### Frame 226

Draw an arrow to show the first move in the White mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_282_2_5108.png)

---

### Frame 226 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_283_2_5469.png)

(... and mate on the next move.)

---

### Frame 227

Draw an arrow to show the first move in the White mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_283_1_5105.png)

---

### Frame 227 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_284_2_5471.png)

(After Rook-takes-Pawn-check, King-takes-Rook, the Queen moves four squares to the right to give mate.)

---

### Frame 228

Draw an arrow to show the first move in the White mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_284_1_5103.png)

---

### Frame 228 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_285_1_5099.png)

(Then the other Rook moyes one square to the left to mate.)

---

### Frame 229

![Diagram](images/page_285_2_5100.png)

A. Here White follows a slightly different theme in bringing about mate.

![Diagram](images/page_285_3_5101.png)

B. The key first move is a check by White's Knight. Since Black's King cannot move, the Black Pawn must capture.

![Diagram](images/page_286_1_5097.png)

C. The White Queen delivers the mate.

---

### Frame 230

The next three positions look somewhat similar, but each allows for a different type of mating combination by White.

![Diagram](images/page_287_1_5095.png)

What is White's key first move in this position?

☐ Knight checks

☐ Queen-takes-Pawn-check

☐ Queen-takes-Rook-check

---

### Frame 230 - Answer

Queen-takes-Pawn-check

(Then on Rook-takes-Queen, Rook down mates.)

---

### Frame 231

![Diagram](images/page_288_1_5093.png)

What is White's key first move in this position?

☐ Knight checks

☐ Queen-takes-Pawn-check

☐ Queen-takes-Rook-check

---

### Frame 231 - Answer

Knight checks

(After Black plays Pawn-takes-Knight, White mates with his Rook. The important feature is that White can reach the vertical file leading to Black's King with one of his heavy pieces&mdash;Queen or, as here, Rook&mdash;to give mate.)

---

### Frame 232

![Diagram](images/page_289_1_5091.png)

What is White's key first move in this position?

☐ Knight checks

☐ Queen-takes-Pawn-check

☐ Queen-takes-Rook-check

---

### Frame 232 - Answer

Queen-takes-Rook-check

(After King-takes-Queen, Rook down mates. Note that here the Knight check fails because Black can reply with Rook-takes-Knight-check.)

---

### Frame 233

![Diagram](images/page_290_1_5089.png)

This position looks harmless, but White can mate in three moves by *first* driving the King into the corner, and *then* mating with one of the themes you have learned.

What is White's first move?

What is the second White move?

---

### Frame 233 - Answer

Knight checks

Rook-takes-Pawn-check

(Then White's third move is to move his other Rook over to the right, giving mate.)

---

### Frame 234

You have now learned several ways to push home mates when the enemy King is hemmed in on the corner. In each of the following positions, decide whether any one of those themes is available to White.

![Diagram](images/page_291_1_5087.png)

Can White mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

If so, draw an arrow to show his first move.

---

### Frame 234 - Answer

yes

![Diagram](images/page_292_1_5245.png)

(On King-takes-Queen, Rook over mates.)

---

### Frame 235

![Diagram](images/page_292_2_5258.png)

Can White mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

If so, draw an arrow to show his first move.

---

### Frame 235 - Answer

yes

![Diagram](images/page_293_1_5256.png)

(The Knight check drives the King into the corner. Then Rook-takes-Pawn-check; King-takes-Rook: Rook over mates.)

---

### Frame 236

![Diagram](images/page_293_2_5473.png)

Can White mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

If so, draw an arrow to show his first move.

---

### Frame 236 - Answer

yes

![Diagram](images/page_294_1_5253.png)

(After Black plays King-takes-Rook, White delivers mate with the remaining Rook. White's Queen cannot mate because it is needed to cover the two potential fleeing squares at X and Y.)

---

### Frame 237

![Diagram](images/page_294_2_5254.png)

Can White mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

If so, draw an arrow to show his first move.

---

### Frame 237 - Answer

no

(The Queen sacrifice does not work. At the end, the Black Bishop is waiting to capture White's Rook.)

---

### Frame 238

White has forced Black to make a Pawn weakness in front of his King. Draw an arrow showing White's first move in a mating combination:

![Diagram](images/page_295_1_5251.png)

---

### Frame 238 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_296_2_5475.png)

(When the Black King moves, the Queen mates on square K. This position is from my 1957 game with Arthur Feuerstein in New York. He avoided this position only at the cost of giving up material, and lost soon anyway.)

---

### Frame 239

![Diagram](images/page_296_1_5249.png)

Can White mate?

☐ yes

☐ no

If so, draw an arrow to show his first move.

---

### Frame 239 - Answer

![Diagram](images/page_297_1_5247.png)

yes

(Black plays Pawn-takes-Knight, White checks by moving his Rook three squares to the right, Queen-takes-Rook, the other Rook takes the Queen, checkmate.)

---

## Page 298

SUMMARY

Attacks on the Enemy Pawn Cover

With the conclusion of this chapter, you have at your disposal several weapons and techniques necessary to force mate. Here is an extremely difficult combination from my game with James Sherwin in the 1957 United States Championship. The main theme is similar to one you've seen in this book.

Here is the critical position:

Sherwin
![Diagram](images/page_298_1_5381.png)
Fischer (to move)

Diagram A

I (White) played Rook-takes-Pawn! If Black had then played Rook-takes-Rook, he would have been mated (do you see how?). Sherwin actually played his Rook to my back rank, giving check. I could have interposed with my Rook, giving check with my Bishop ("discovered check!") while doing so, but I had something better in mind: I interposed my Queen! (See Diagram B.)

Sherwin
![Diagram](images/page_299_1_5378.png)
Fischer

Diagram B  
the Queen has interposed!

Here Black was faced with the threat of Rook-takesRook-mate! Taking my queen wouldn't have helped him because I could then have played Rook-takes-Rook, "discovering" a check with my Bishop. (See Diagram C below.)

Sherwin
![Diagram](images/page_299_2_5379.png)
Fischer

Diagram C (variation)  
Check by the Bishop!

If Sherwin had then moved his king into the corner, Rook-takes-Rook would have been mate! Or, if the Rook interposes, the Rook on the left would mate Black. Taking my Bishop with his Queen wouldn't have helped because I would have played Rook-takes-Rook-check first and then (!) Pawn-takes-Black Queen. (See Diagram D below.)

Sherwin
![Diagram](images/page_300_1_5375.png)
Fischer

Diagram D (variation)  
Rook-check; then Pawn-captures-Black Queen.

This would have left me with enough material advantage to win: Rook and Pawn against Knight.

Sherwin tried to make the best of a bad bargain (from Diagram B) by moving his Pawn up next to his Queen, creating an escape square for his King. Now I played Queen-takes-Rook! (See Diagram E.)

Sherwin
![Diagram](images/page_300_2_5376.png)
Fischer

Diagram E  
... after Queen-takes-Rook!

This won a Rook, and Black soon resigned. Note that Black would still have remained a Rook "down" if he had played Queen-takes-Queen, giving check. How? Rook would have interposed! (The Rook would have exposed the Bishop check&mdash;again!&mdash;and when Black had replied to the check, I would have captured his Queen.)

---

# Chapter 6: FINAL REVIEW

The criterion positions at the end of this chapter will test your understanding of all the themes and variations you have learned. First, however, let us summarize these themes and variations. You have learned the basic elements of checkmate, the back-rank mates and defenses, displacing themes, and an assortment of sacrificial combinations. The following diagrams illustrate these concepts in their basic form. I have removed all the window dressing, leaving just the basic elements.

---

### Frame 240

MATING THEMES

Observe the following positions, which review the various types of mating themes and their variations:

![Diagram](images/page_303_1_5260.png)

A. An elementary backrank mate. (Black's interpositions are useless.)

![Diagram](images/page_303_2_5282.png)

B. A back-rank combination. (It's three against two and a back-rank mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_303_3_5283.png)

C. Eliminating a backrank defender. (After Black's Queen captures, White's Rooks can mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_303_4_5477.png)

D. Eliminating a backrank defender. (Black's King recaptures; White's Queen mates on the back rank, since it also blocks escape square A.)

![Diagram](images/page_304_1_5277.png)

E. Drawing away a defender. (The Knight must capture, allowing White's other Rook to mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_304_2_5278.png)

F. Driving away the enemy King. (After Black's King moves, White can mate on the back rank.)

![Diagram](images/page_304_3_5279.png)

G. The Bishop drives away the King. (The Bishop takes off the Pawn, giving check. Black can't play King-takes-Bishop because the White Queen protects the Bishop; nor can he play Queen-takes-Bishop since the White Queen pins the Black Queen. So, the King must retreat into the corner. Then Queen-takes-Queen is mate.) 

![Diagram](images/page_304_4_5280.png)

H. The Knight drives the King into the corner (allowing Rook-takes-Rookmate).

![Diagram](images/page_305_1_5272.png)

I. The Rook drives the King away (allowing Queen-takes-Rook-mate).

![Diagram](images/page_305_2_5273.png)

J. White checks with his Knight, in an attempt to drive the Black King into the corner and mate with Queen-takes-Queen. Black stalls by playing Pawn-takes-Knight, but then White checks with his Rook (three squares to left) and White mates with Queen-takes-Queen.

![Diagram](images/page_305_3_5274.png)

K. A Queen sacrifice. (After Black's Queen captures, it will be pinned; the White Rook can then mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_305_4_5275.png)

L. Queen sacrifice. (Black's Rook captures; White's Rook checks; Black's Rook interposes; Whites Bishop drives the King into the corner. Then White mates with Rook-takes Rook.)


![Diagram](images/page_306_1_5267.png)

M. Another Queen sacrifice variation. (Black Queen captures; Rook at far right checks; Black Queen interposes; Rook takes Queen, giving mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_306_2_5268.png)

N. Mating a hemmed-in King. (King must capture; White Rook mates.)

![Diagram](images/page_306_3_5269.png)

O. Hemming in the King. (The Black King must move into the corner, allowing White to sacrifice his Queen and mate with his Rook.)

![Diagram](images/page_306_4_5270.png)

P. Hemming in the King: a variation. (Black's Pawn must capture, allowing White's Rook to mate.)

---

### Frame 241

THE DEFENSES

The following positions review the defenses against various attacks:

![Diagram](images/page_307_1_5262.png)

A. Black's Queen should capture. (If the Black Rook captures, White would mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_307_2_5263.png)

B. Black's Rook should capture. (If the King captures, White would mate.)

C. Black's Queen should interpose. (If the Black Rook takes White's Queen, White would mate.)

![Diagram](images/page_307_4_5265.png)

D. White Queen sacrifice fails. (Black's Rook takes Queen; White Rook checks; Black Rook interposes; and now the check by White Bishop does no good.)

### Frame 242

Remember the three ways to get out of check:

![Diagram](images/page_308_1_5352.png)

A. Interposition.

![Diagram](images/page_308_2_5353.png)

B. Capturing a checking piece.

![Diagram](images/page_308_3_5354.png)

C. King flees.

And remember about pins against the King:

![Diagram](images/page_309_1_5348.png)

D. Mate: the pinned piece cannot capture.

CRITERION POSITIONS

Now you're ready to try your skill at sorting out all of the concepts you've learned in a series of complex positions. Some of these positions are difficult. You'll have to decide in each case whether or not White can mate. In some of the positions, he cannot. Wherever there is a mate, draw an arrow to show the key first move for White.

## Page 343 Box 2

A FINAL WORD


As one last illustration of the employment of the mating themes taught in this program, here is the finish of a game that helped me retain my title in the most recent U.S. Championship (December, 1965). In the position diagrammed below, I (White) forced my opponent's resignation with one crushing move. You might see if you can find that move-although I won't require you to do so. It's a difficult one since Black-can escape checkmate, but...

Benko
![Diagram](images/page_343_2_5434.png)
Fischer

White's Queen checked on the back rank, and Black resigned. Black's only chance would be to play Rooktakes-Queen. (If the Knight interposes, the Pawn takes the Knight and promotes to a Queen, with check and mate on the next move.) The capture allows the White Bishop to check, whereupon Black must give up his Queen and Rook to prevent mate: the Rook interposes; Bishop-takes-Rook-check; Queen-takes-Bishop; and Pawn-takes-Queen. Here is the resulting position:

Benko
![Diagram](images/page_344_1_5432.png)
Fischer

White has a Rook and two Pawns for a Knight; besides this material advantage, he will soon be able to promote one of his advanced Pawns.

Congratulations! You have just completed the program.

I sincerely hope that my book will help you play better Chess. It will be a good sign if you can now beat some of your old opponents who have not taken the program.
