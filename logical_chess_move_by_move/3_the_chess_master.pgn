***The Chess Master Explains his Ideas***

Let us imagine ourselves sitting beside a master player who reveals his thoughts in the course of a game. We can then thrill to the excitement of combinative play and revel in the pleasure of watching ideas come to life. We can see how the tactical themes, the pin, the knight fork, the double attack and the mating combination (the sort of thing we could always spot if similar opportunities only presented themselves) are prepared for by the strategy of setting the scene for their appearance.

The games that follow are not primarily displays of pretty fireworks, nor do they feature explosive (and sometimes unpredictable) attacks. They may not conform to the popular concept of brilliancy, but they do show how circumstances can be shaped by iron control of the forces involved. They also show what can be accomplished by applying the three great principles that Capablanca advocated and himself utilized so successfully:

1. in the opening, rapid and efficient development;
2. in the middlegame, coordination of pieces;
3. in the ending, accurate and time-saving play.

These games are wonderful illustrations of the efficacy of Capablanca’s principles in practical play. In *my* book, games such as these are brilliancies.
 
In the game Capablanca-Mattison (No. 24) White does nothing but develop his pieces, but it’s enough to summon up all sorts of piquant little combinations. What makes the feat impressive is that all the combinations are in White’s favour, right up to the threat of mate in one (a smothered mate), which is enough to persuade Black to resign. A Capablanca jewel!

Janowsky-Alapin (No. 25) is undoubtedly the most beautiful game Janowsky ever played. His manoeuvring on the open d-file leads to the creation of a passed pawn. The pawn must be blockaded, and Black shows ingenuity in shifting blockaders so that a weaker piece keeps replacing a stronger one. Then comes an interesting phase where Janowsky’s pawns reach out to the dark squares on the seventh rank, gripping them like so many fingers at the throat of an adversary. The finale includes an amusing shifting of attack to various files, which Black must try to imitate in defence. After a remarkable tour by his king, Black’s pawns begin to fall and a pathway is cleared for the advance of Bernstein’s passed pawns.

“Étude on the Black Keys” might be a title for the Bernstein-Mieses (No. 26) game. Bernstein fastens on the weaknesses of his opponent’s dark squares and plants pieces in these holes in his position. After a remarkable tour by his king, Black’s pawns begin to fall and a pathway is cleared for the advance of Bernstein’s passed pawns.

Chekhover-Rudakovsky (No. 27) is an unknown masterpiece in which the themes we discussed in the first two sections of the book (Kingside Attack and the Queen’s Pawn Opening) are beautifully blended. Black omits the freeing ...c5 move, a circumstance which his opponent immediately exploits. Chekhover, who controls the c-file, restrains and then blockades the enemy c-pawn. With Black tied up on the queenside, he switches the attack suddenly to the kingside, giving his opponent the job of defending on both wings, to say nothing of the centre. Black is forced to play ...g6 and weaken his dark squares f6 and h6. White’s queen pounces on one of the weak squares. Then begins a series of mating threats on the kingside, which culminates in winning the queen – on the queenside!

Tarrasch-Mieses (No. 28) is notable for Tarrasch’s skilful refutation of a premature attack. His gains of tempo in the opening are carried over into the ending, so that what remains is a clear-cut demonstration of the technique for converting a pawn majority on the queenside into a passed pawn.

Marshall-Tarrasch (No. 29) is a little-known masterpiece, which features a duel between a genius of attack and a virtuoso of defence. The methods of the positional player prove superior, his continual acquisition of territory driving White to the wall. Against Tarrasch’s steady accumulation of positional advantages, any attack by his opponent seems futile.
There follow three games in which the motif is: get a passed pawn, move it up the board, and win!

In the first, Capablanca-Villegas (No. 30), White offers to sacrifice his queen, but where in most games such an offer is the high point of a combination, here it is subordinate to the grand strategy of securing a positional advantage. It leads to control of the d-file, and this in turn is converted to a queenside majority of three pawns to two. Skilful play resolves this into a lone passed pawn, heavily blockaded, until another queen sacrifice opens wide the gates.

Havasi-Capablanca (No. 31) is a superb specimen of positional play featuring the art of squeezing the most out of a tiny advantage. Capablanca secures a pawn majority on the queenside and sets to work to translate it into a passed pawn. This he does by getting control of the open c-file and then exploiting the weakness of his opponent’s light squares. The rest consists of escorting the passed pawn safely to the queening square. The ending that follows is a fascinating study and illustrates a ‘domination’ theme rare in actual play. There is a pawn to be queened, but it would take an eagle eye to find the particular pawn that will be crowned.

Canal-Capablanca (No. 32) is a game for the connoisseur. Canal surprises Capablanca by a combination that wins two pieces for a rook. Or was it a surprise? Apparently Capablanca anticipated the combination and, looking further into the position than Canal, saw resources that were not revealed to his opponent. The ending that follows is a fascinating study and illustrates a ‘domination’ theme rare in actual play. There is a pawn to be queened, but it would take an eagle eye to find the particular pawn that will be crowned.

Rubinstein-Maroczy (No. 33) is a splendid all-around performance. Rubinstein’s economic development in the opening results in magnificent middlegame centralization, and this in turn is a prelude to a kingside attack in the ending. Not the least of this game’s attractions is the remarkable use of d5 as a pivot for the manoeuvres of Rubinstein’s knight, bishop, rook and queen, who each utilize this square in turn as a landing field!

1. d4 { The popular impression of king’s pawn openings is that they offer all sorts of opportunities for whipping up a quick attack. A variety of gambits can be played, pieces may be sacrificed to open lines, combinations ventured on, and speculation indulged in – anything for the sake of mate. Sometimes these tactics succeed, but very often the gambit player finds himself at the wrong end of the attack, as wide-open positions are as dangerous for one side as for the other. In queen’s pawn openings, the ideal to strive for is development for its own sake. The attack is not the ‘be-all and end-all’. It is not deliberately played for, but, strangely enough, the very fact that all the pieces are developed economically, that they are put to work as quickly as possible on the squares where they function best, seems to imbue them with marvellous powers of attack. Combinations come into life out of nothing! Can it be that the simple posting of pieces where they have the greatest freedom of movement and the greatest command of the board generates in them so much dynamic energy that it must be released somehow? And can it be that knowledge of this fact is what makes the virtuosi of positional play repress their instinct to attack until the time is ripe for an attack to be unleashed? White’s move of the d-pawn begins the process of getting all the pieces into play as quickly as possible. Two of them are now free to make their debut, while the pawn that released them occupies the centre of the stage. } 1... Nf6 { A developing move, whose object (besides the commendable one of bringing a piece to its most suitable square) is to prevent White from gaining too much ground with 2 e4. } 2. c4 { This move does many things: 1) it begins an attack on the d5-square; 2) it keeps the c-file open for the use of the heavy pieces; 3) it offers the queen a diagonal; 4) it hinders Black from establishing a pawn in the centre by 2...d5, as White’s reply 3 cxd5 compelling a recapture with a piece would leave Black with no pawn in the centre. } 2... e6 { Black clears a path for the dark-squared bishop and indicates that he will go in for an active defence. } 3. Nc3 { White’s motive is evident: he develops the b1-knight first, to support an advance of the e-pawn. } 3... Bb4 { To this, Black counters by clamping a pin on the knight. If White were to play 4 e4, then 4...Nxe4 would leave him helpless to recapture. } 4. Qc2 { With a twofold purpose: to meet 4...Bxc3+ with 5 Qxc3, keeping White’s pawn structure intact, and to threaten again the advance 5 e4. There is a prevalent concept that in the opening there is a ‘best move’ at every point. The belief is that the chess master memorizes every one of these best moves and its proper reply. That such reasoning is specious is obvious: the very fact that millions of games have been played without duplication of moves is proof enough in itself. Let us consider the position on the board. Besides the text-move (4 Qc2), there are at least seven excellent alternatives, each of which has enthusiastic advocates. They are: 4 Qb3; 4 Bd2; 4 a3; 4 Bg5; 4 e3; 4 g3; and 4 Nf3. Which of these is best? No one can say for sure, but the move that leads into positions congenial to your style is the best move, and the one you should play. } 4... c5 { Black too can conduct the defence (or the counterattack) in the manner that suits his style and temperament. The move he plays immediately disputes White’s control of the centre. It does other things, too: it gives the queen more scope, opens the c-file, protects the bishop, etc. However, there are other moves, equally effective, at Black’s disposal. He can select from these replies, each of which has something to recommend it: 4...Nc6; 4...d6; 4...d5; 4...O-O; and 4...b6. There is something for every taste. } 5. dxc5 { Strongest for various reasons: White does not lose time in taking the pawn, as Black in recapturing will return the lost tempo. The open d-file resulting from 5 dxc5 will benefit White, who will occupy d 1 with a rook and exert pressure along the length of it, especially endangering the backward d-pawn. Other continuations are less energetic. For instance, after 5 e3, Black frees himself by 5...d5, while after 5 Nf3 cxd4 6 Nxd4 Nc6 White has lost the initiative. } 5... Nc6 { Black develops another piece before recapturing the pawn. } 6. Nf3 { Somewhere about this stage, the amateur wants things to happen. He begins to look around for surprise moves. “There must be a brilliancy in the position!” The great master, in the same situation, is content to make simple moves. He knows that if he keeps on bringing pieces into play, there will be no need to look for winning combinations. They will evolve naturally out of the position and spring up all over the place! } 6... Bxc5 { Further delay in recovering the pawn might be dangerous. } 7. Bf4 { The aggressive 7 Bg5 is more usual, to pin the knight and keep Black under pressure, but no fault can be found with this method of development. It looks mild, but the bishop surveys an important diagonal and bears down on d6, a tender spot in Black’s position. } 7... d5 { Vigorously challenging White’s possession of the centre. } 8. e3 { Another quiet move which liberates one bishop and strengthens the position of the other. } 8... Qa5 { Black spies a chance to start an attack which will result in saddling White with an isolated c-pawn – a slight positional weakness, so he begins an action against the knight, but “such artificial manoeuvres,” says Tartakower, “can hardly succeed against a Capablanca.” Black should instead do something to get his c8-bishop into play, for example 8...a6 9 Be2 dxc4 10 Bxc4 b5 11 Be2 Qb6 (not at once 11...Bb7 on account of 12 Nxb5) 12 O-O Bb7. } 9. Be2 { Yet another modest move, but it is packed with more energy than you might suspect. It accomplishes these objectives: 1) it activates a piece, by getting it off the first rank; 2) it develops the bishop at e2 so that it can move to f3 and attack the centre; 3) it clears away the kingside, making early castling possible; 4) it prepares the cooperation of the rooks on the first rank, subsequent to castling. What was wrong with playing the more aggressive-looking 9 Bd3? For one thing, the reply 9...Nb4 enables Black to force an exchange of knight for bishop. White would lose the services of a piece valuable for its potential influence on the centre. Why not then prepare to develop the bishop at d3 by playing 9 a3 first? The answer is that time is too valuable in the opening to waste on unnecessary pawn moves. Only those pawn moves that are essential to the development of pieces should be made. The additional circumstance that 9 a3 weakens the light squares on the queenside is more proof that such strategy is artificial and time-wasting. } 9... Bb4 { In contrast to White’s classically simple method of development, Black moves the same bishop a third time in the opening, in order to inflict his opponent with an isolated pawn. Such an attempt is premature in view of Black’s incomplete development. Instead, a plausible continuation is 9...O-O 10 O-O dxc4 11 Bxc4 Bd7, when Black has a fair game. } 10. O-O { The king is made secure, while the h 1-rook moves closer to the centre, the theatre of action. The rook, of course, will try to seize an open file, or, if none is available, one which is likely to be opened. } 10... Bxc3 { The bishop has moved four times to make this exchange for a knight that has moved only once! So much shifting around of one piece indicates that the strategy behind it must be faulty. } 11. bxc3 { Despite White’s doubled c-pawn, he enjoys these advantages: 1) he has two active bishops against Black’s knight and bishop; 2) all of his minor pieces are in play while Black still has a bishop on the first rank; 3) his rooks are in touch with each other and ready to seize the half-open b- and d-files; 4) his king is safely tucked away in a corner while Black’s is out in the open; 5) his queen is ideally posted and has more influence on the centre than does Black’s, standing at the side of the board; 6) an exchange of pawns in the centre (which looks inevitable) will open lines of attack, a circumstance that favours the player whose development is superior - in this case, White; 7) he maintains the initiative. } 11... O-O { One of Black’s difficulties is resolved with his king’s escape to safer quarters. Developing the bishop instead was somewhat risky, since after 11...Bd7 12 Rab1 (attacking the b7-pawn) 12...b6 13 Bd6 White stops kingside castling and threatens 14 Rb5 Qa6 15 cxd5 exd5 16 Rxd5, and the discovered attack on the queen wins a pawn for White. } 12. Rab1 { Another of those subtle moves, whose purpose the average player usually fails to see. “What use is it,” he says, “to waste a rook move in attacking a pawn that is adequately protected?” True, the pawn is defended, but by a bishop which cannot develop without abandoning the pawn. Sooner or later, Black will be compelled to play ...b6, or have three pieces on his first rank interfering with each other. There are drawbacks to ...b6, though, for example Black’s queen will be cut off and prevented from returning to the kingside and the defence of the king. In addition, his c6-knight’s position will be insecure, once the prop (the b7-pawn) is removed from under it. White’s move is simple and quiet, but it exerts uncomfortable pressure on Black’s queenside, makes normal development difficult, and creates permanent weaknesses which lend themselves to exploitation. } 12... Qa3 { Black wants to develop his bishop, and for that purpose he must play ...b6, but to do so at once might endanger the queen by cutting off her line of retreat. For instance, 12...b6 13 Bd6 Rd8 14 Rb5 Qa6 15 cxd5 Rxd6 (15...exd5 permits 16 Rxd5 discovering an attack on the queen) 16 dxc6 Rxc6 17 Nd4 Rc7 18 Re5 wins material, as 18...Qb7 loses after 19 Bf3 Nd5 20 Bxd5 leading to a surprising back-rank mate following 20...exd5 21 Re8#. } 13. Rfd1! { With the posting of this rook on the partly open d-file, White’s development has been completed in an ideal way, every piece taking its best post in no more than one move. White has not so much as hinted at an attacking combination until every piece has been put to work. } 13... b6 { To enable the bishop to come out, but the advance of the pawn takes away the c6-knight’s support and weakens its position. Guarding the b-pawn by 13...Qe7 instead does not help much, since the bishop cannot develop at d7 next move without cutting off the queen’s protection of the pawn. Nor can Black try to simplify by 13...dxc4 as the reply 14 Bd6 wins the exchange. } 14. cxd5 { The attack begins! The first blow destroys Black’s pawn-centre. } 14... Nxd5 { The recapture with the pawn, 14...exd5, is bad in view of 15 c4!. Black could not then escape by 15...dxc4 since 16 Bd6 attacks queen and rook, while protecting the pawn by 15..Be6 yields to 16 cxd5 Bxd5 17 Rxd5 Nxd5 18 Qxc6, and White has won two pieces for a rook. } 15. Ng5! { A master stroke! The brutal threat of 16 Qxh7# disguises the two real purposes of the move: the strategic concept of forcing Black to move one of his kingside pawns, thereby loosening the defensive structure; and the clearance of the f6-square for the benefit of the dark-squared bishop, who will bear down heavily on the long diagonal. } 15... f5 { Black had two alternatives: 1) 15...Nf6 avoids moving one of the pawns, but 16 Bd6 wins the exchange. 2) 15...g6 leaves Black’s position riddled with weaknesses on the dark squares. Therefore, Black moves the f-pawn, staving off the mate, but it weakens his e-pawn and ties the bishop down to its defence. } 16. Bf3! { This arrangement of bishops gives them tremendous raking power along the two parallel diagonals. White’s chief threat is 17 Rxd5 exd5 18 Bxd5+ Kh8 19 Bxc6 followed by 20 Bxa8, sweeping away a good part of Black’s army. } 16... Qc5 { The queen rushes to the aid of the vulnerable knights. This is what happens on other defences: 1) 16...Nde7 17 Bd6 Qa5 18 Bxe7 Nxe7 19 Bxa8, and White wins a whole rook. 2) 16...Nce7 17 c4 Nb4 18 Rxb4 Qxb4 19 Bxa8, and White wins a piece. 3) 16...Nxf4 17 Bxc6 Rb8 18 exf4, and White has won a piece. 4) 16...Qxc3 17 Qxc3 Nxc3 18 Bxc6 Nxd1 19 Rxd1 Ba6 20 Bxa8 Rxa8, and White is a piece ahead. After Black’s actual move, he seems to have escaped the worst, but White has an ingenious way to get at the knights: } 17. c4! { This stab at the knight looks harmless, the pawn being pinned and unable to capture, but the point of 17 c4 is to use the pawn to support an attack by 18 Rb5. This will drive the queen off and make the capture 19 cxd5 possible. The combinations now appear in quick succession. } 17... Ndb4 { Counterattack on the queen. All other attempts at defence fail, viz.: 1) 17...Nf6 18 Bd6 Qa5 19 Bxc6 and both Black’s rooks are en prise. 2) 17...Nxf4 18 Rb5! (a pretty ‘in-between’ move) 18...Qe7 (alternatively 18...Nb4 19 Qd2 Qxc4 20 Rxb4 and White wins) 19 Bxc6 Qxg5 20 exf4, and the attack on the queen leaves Black no time to save his a8-rook. 3) 17...Nde7 18 Bd6 Qa5 19 Bxe7 winning a whole rook. } 18. Qb3 { White’s queen must move, but the threat of 19 Bd6 hangs over Black like the Sword of Damocles. } 18... e5 { Not only because there is no other antidote to 19 Bd6, but with the hope of curbing the terrible bishops by putting obstacles in their paths. } 19. a3! { This starts a beautiful combination at one end of the board which culminates in a queen sacrifice followed by a smothered mate over at the other end! } 19... Na6 { The only other move, 19...exf4, allows White to force the win by 20 axb4 Qe7 21 Bxc6 Rb8 22 exf4, and the extra piece wins easily. } 20. Bxc6 { After the recapture 20...Qxc6, there comes 21 c5+ Kh8 22 Nf7+ Kg8 (or 22...Rxf7 23 Rd8+ and White forces mate) 23 Nh6++ Kh8 24 Qg8+! Rxg8 25 Nf7#! Black did not wait to be convinced by a demonstration over the board but turned down his king in surrender. An exquisite game played with elegance and precision. Capablanca’s own comment on it was “I made a few little combinations in this game.” } 1-0

1. d4 { White opens by stationing a pawn in the centre. This pawn performs various services: } 1... d5 { Black follows suit, establishing a pawn in the centre, and prevents White from continuing with his intended 2 e4. } 2. c4 { White offers a pawn to induce Black to surrender the centre. White’s move is also an attack on the d-pawn, by means of which he hopes to uproot it and its hold on the centre. } 2... e6 { The customary device for maintaining a pawn in the centre. In the event of White’s playing 3 cxd5, Black must be ready to replace the d-pawn with another pawn. It would not do to recapture with a piece. The piece could be driven off by White’s e-pawn, leaving White in full possession of the central squares. For instance, after 2...Nf6 3 cxd5 Nxd5 4 e4 Nf6 5 Nc3 White holds all the trumps. } 3. Nc3 { This is more enterprising than the passive 3 Nf3. Pressure is added to the attack on d5, and the knight also takes a hand in the battle for control of e4. One of White’s objects in queen’s pawn openings is to effect a subsequent advance of the e-pawn, just as in king’s pawn openings an effort is made to gain more ground with a later d4. } 3... Be7 { The usual move at this point is 3...Nf6 but Black transposes moves to prevent his knight being pinned. } 4. Nf3 { White is content with simple development and places the king’s knight at its most suitable post. } 4... Nf6 { Black postponed this move, excellent though it is, and now makes it reluctantly, but how else can he develop the kingside and prepare to castle? } 5. Bg5 { This is not really a pin, but its effect is somewhat similar. Pressure is exerted on the knight, the bishop behind it and even on the last in line, the queen. } 5... h6 { Alapin can’t stand pins or pseudo-pins! He attacks the bishop at once, to force it to a decision. } 6. Bh4 { Whether objectively this is the strongest move is immaterial; the fact that the bishop’s pressure bothers Black is enough reason for Janowsky to maintain the pin! } 6... dxc4 { Black opens the position to give his pieces more elbow room, but with this capture he gives up his hold on the centre. } 7. e3 { The simplest way to regain the pawn. The f1-bishop will capture it and make a developing move at the same time. } 7... a6 { Ready to counter 8 Bxc4 with 8...b5, attacking White’s bishop and gaining a tempo for the development of his own bishop. } 8. Bxc4 { Material is now equal, but White’s prospects are better: he has two more pieces in active play than Black, and his pawn position in the centre is superior. } 8... b5 { Black’s chief purpose in this pawn attack is to vacate the b7-square for his light-squared bishop. } 9. Bb3 { Nobody has yet decided whether this or d3 is the better retreat for the bishop. At b3 the bishop strikes at Black’s centre, but those who favour d3 reason that from there the bishop helps control the vital e4-square and is aimed at the enemy king after a subsequent ...O-O. } 9... Nbd7 { Naturally, the knight does not go to c6 where it would obstruct the c-pawn. The pawn must not be hindered from carrying out its mission in life, which is to attack White’s centre and open a file for Black’s rooks. The knight’s development looks clumsy, but it does back up the other knight, and it is ready to support a thrust at the centre by ...c5 or ...e5. } 10. Qe2 { Notice how an expert player puts all his pieces to work before starting any decisive action! This does not look like much of a move for so powerful a piece as the queen, but the simple act of getting a piece off the back rank advances the cause of development and constitutes progress. Two more points: in the early stages of the game, the queen is most happily placed close to home, for instance at c2 or e2. In getting off the back rank, the queen permits the rooks (after the king castles) to get in touch with each other. A more aggressive development (generally for the sake of picking up a stray pawn) is only courting danger. } 10... c6 { It is hard to tell exactly what Black had in mind with this move. He may have feared the advance 11 d5 by White, or perhaps he wanted to create an outlet for the queen on the queenside. In any case, the move is definitely inferior to 10...c5, disputing the centre without any more delay. } 11. O-O { Castling by White is an aggressive measure, to press the rook into active service. } 11... O-O { Castling by Black is defensive in purpose, to get the king out of harm’s way. } 12. Rac1 { The rook comes to the head of the c-file, control of which is one of White’s main objectives in this opening. } 12... Bb7 { With the development of the light-squared bishop, Black seems to have solved one of the problems that besets the defender in queen’s pawn openings, but he isn’t out of the woods yet! } 13. Rfd1 { Excellent play! The rooks are now beautifully posted. The pressure on the d-file makes it dangerous for Black to try to free himself by 13...c5, as the reply 14 dxc5 opens a file for the d 1-rook. } 13... Rc8 { Black gives the c-pawn more support in an effort to get in 14...c5. This would free his position and let him put up a fight for the c-file. } 14. Ne5! { White is now ideally developed, with every one of his pieces taking an active part in the game. Black, on the contrary, is hampered by the restricted mobility of his pieces. White’s knight move prevents a freeing attempt by 14...c5, since 15 dxc5 Rxc5 (15.... Bxc5 16 Nxd7 leaves Black unable to recapture) 16 Bxf6 Bxf6 17 Nxd7 wins a knight and attacks a couple of rooks. } 14... Nxe5 { Black tries to relieve the pressure by exchanging whatever pieces he can. } 15. dxe5 { This exchange suits White in that he has opportunities for attack along the newly opened d-file. Another effect arising from the pawn’s recapture is the creation of a strong point at d6, a circumstance which White hopes to exploit by planting a piece on that square. } 15... Nd5 { The knight must block off the rook’s attack on the queen. If instead 15...Nd7, then 16 Bxe7 (in order to remove the guardian of the d6 square) 16...Qxe7 17 f4 and White will either entrench his rook at d6 and double rooks on the d-file or manoeuvre his knight to d6 by way of e4. } 16. Bxe7 { In order to benefit from the weakness of d6 it is necessary to remove the bishop that defends the dark squares. } 16... Nxc3 { Black destroys the knight before it does him any damage. The alternative 16...Qxe7 lets White swing his knight over to e4 and then anchor it either at d6 or c5. } 17. Rxc3 { Certainly not 17 Rxd8 (nor 17 Bxd8) 17...Nxe2+ 18 Kf1 Nxcl, and Black wins. The text gains a tempo for White in his plan to double rooks on the d-file. } 17... Qxe7 { Material is even after this recapture, but White has a slightly superior position. Is this enough of an advantage for a master to squeeze out a win? White’s specific advantage consists of his possession of the only completely open file, and the pressure he exerts on the strategically important d6-square. } 18. Rcd3! { Much stronger than the plausible continuation 18 Rd6. The reply to that would be 18...c5 whereupon doubling the rooks by 19 Rcd3 allows the pawn fork 19...c4 and Black wins a piece. White’s actual move doubles his rooks without loss of time and also threatens to win a piece by 19 Rd7. } 18... Rfd8 { The dilemma which the weaker side always faces in this sort of situation is that if he does not dispute the enemy at every point and fight for control of every important file, diagonal or square, he will slowly be driven back and crushed to the wall; if he does oppose him at every turn, the resulting exchanges will simplify the position without improving his chances. In this particular position, Black could hardly delay opposing rooks, as he was threatened with invasion on the seventh rank by 19 Rd7, as well as 19 Qd2, tripling the heavy pieces on the file. Such a massing of power on the open file would of course be overwhelming! } 19. Rd6! { White stakes out a claim to the d6-square by settling a piece firmly there. } 19... Rxd6 { Otherwise, White plays 20 Qd2 next, with intolerable pressure on Black’s position. } 20. exd6 { This gives White a passed pawn, which exerts a terrific influence on the opponent’s way of life. Nimzowitsch calls particular attention to “the lust to expand in a passed pawn” and says that it must be regarded as “a criminal who should be kept under lock and key”. To prevent any further advance of the passed pawn, Black must blockade it by placing a piece in its path. In effect, to keep the pawn under surveillance, he must lose the services of one of his four remaining pieces! If constant vigilance is necessary to keep the pawn quiescent, it is obvious that Black will be too busy defending to think of counter-attack. On the other hand, White is free to switch the attack from one point to another! } 20... Qd7 { This is practically forced, as the pawn must be blockaded, and at once! Another forward step by the pawn might be fatal! Witness this possibility: 20...Qd8 21 d7 Rc7 22 Qd2 (threatening to win by 23 Qd6 followed by 24 Qxc7 and queening the pawn) 22...c5 23 Qa5 Rxd7 24 Qxd8+ and White wins. After Black’s actual move, the pawn is stopped, but in blockading it, Black is tying up the queen, his strongest piece! } 21. e4 { Indicating that he intends to play 22 e5, supporting the d-pawn and further cramping Black’s game. White’s pieces, relieved of the necessity of watching over the d-pawn, could then move freely about the board. } 21... c5 { Black opens a diagonal for his bishop and gives his rook more air. An effort to prevent 22 e5 by 21..f6 would have been met by 22 Qg4 and now either 22...Kf7 23 e5 fxe5 24 Qf5+ Ke8 25 Bxe6 Qd8 26 Qf7# or 22...Re8 23 Bxe6+ Rxe6 24 Qxe6+! Qxe6 25 d7, and White wins. } 22. e5 { Assisting the d-pawn on to the next stage in its career: first, a pawn undistinguished from its fellows, then a passed pawn, now a protected passed pawn, and finally (if it fulfils its brilliant promise) a queen. } 22... c4 { Back to sober reality! Black fights every step of the way to institute countermeasures which will keep his opponent busy on the queenside. } 23. Bc2 { The bishop, though forced back, now overlooks a new diagonal with interesting prospects. } 23... Qc6 { Black does not like to have his strongest piece tied down to the job of watching a passed pawn, so he diverts White’s attention by threatening mate. While White is occupied with stopping the mate, Black will have time to switch blockaders. } 24. f3 { This puts an end to attacks on the long diagonal, as it leaves Black’s queen and bishop biting on granite. } 24... Qc5+ { The chief purpose of the check is to prevent White from playing 25 Qe3 seizing control of the dark-squared diagonals. } 25. Kh1 { White keeps the queens on the board. Apparently he wants to win the game by direct attack, in preference to offering an exchange of queens by 25 Qf2. Such decisions are a matter of style more than anything else. A player who has choice of more than one way of winning should select a method that is congenial to his temperament and aptitudes. In the present position, I imagine that a Rubinstein or a Capablanca would unhesitatingly offer the exchange of queens and simplify, confident in his ability to turn a small but safe advantage into a win; they would be happy to leave the brilliancies to other masters. It is to these varying techniques that we must be grateful for the creation of a wealth of masterpieces in so many colours and moods. After 25 Qf2, if Black avoids the exchange of queens and continues 25...Qxe5, White wins elegantly by 26 Qb6 Bc6 27 Qxc6! Rxc6 28 d7, regaining the queen by promotion and ending up a piece ahead. } 25... Rd8 { The rook takes over the job of keeping the pawn covered. } 26. Qe1! { A very fine move! The queen threatens to invade Black’s kingside by way of 27 Qh4 or his queenside by 27 Qa5. } 26... Rd7 { Nailing down the passed pawn for the time being. } 27. h3 { An outlet for the king in case of need. If White’s queen and rook leave for the attack, his king must not be caught by surprise and mated on the first rank. } 27... Bc6 { Another regrouping so that the rook may leave its post, and the bishop (a lesser piece) stand guard. } 28. f4 { Preparing a breakthrough by 29 f5 – pawns make excellent instruments of attack. They can break into almost any stronghold and make gaps wide enough for an invasion by the pieces. } 28... Ra7 { The rook vacates d7 for occupation by the bishop. } 29. f5! { To this vigorous thrust Black may not reply 29...exf5 as 30 e6 fxe6 (otherwise White obtains two connected passed pawns on the sixth rank) 31 Qxe6+ Kh8 (31...Rf7 32 d7 wins) 32 Qc8+ Kh7 33 Bxf5+ wins for White. } 29... Bd7 { Black completes the changing of the guard. Since one of his pieces must act as blockader, he assigns the task to the least important, the bishop. } 30. f6 { This battering ram of a pawn will force a breach in Black’s defensive structure. White’s threat is 31 Qg3 (intending 32 Qxg7#) 31...g6 32 Bxg6 fxg6 33 Qxg6+, and mate in two. } 30... g6 { On 30...gxf6 White wins by 31 Qg3+ Kh8 (31...Kf8 32 Bh7 mates) 32 Qf4 f5 (or 32...Qxe5 33 Qxh6+ Kg8 34 Qh7+ Kf8 35 Qh8#) 33 Qxh6+ Kg8 34 Qg5+ Kf8 35 Qf6 Kg8 36 Rf1 Bc6 (or else Rf3 and Rg3+) 37 Bxf5 exf5 38 Rxf5 Be4 39 Rh5 with a quick mate. After the actual move, the change in the pawn configuration provides White with fresh objects of attack. One thing he must watch out for, though, is the preservation of his invaluable e-pawn, which so stoutly supports the two advanced pawns. Note that the position of these pawns gives them a powerful grip on the dark squares c7, e7 and g7. These squares are in the enemy’s camp and close to his king, but he (Black) cannot place pieces on those squares. With fewer facilities at his disposal, it will be difficult for Black to beat back the invaders. The play for the win from this point comes under the heading of instruction and entertainment. } 31. Qg3 { Threatening to win at once by 32 Bxg6 fxg6 33 Qxg6+, followed shortly by mate. } 31... Kh7 { The only way to protect the pawn. Advancing it instead by 31...g5 allows White a winning reply in 32 h4. } 32. h4 { The g6-pawn is pinned and White prepares to hit it again by 33 h5. } 32... Qc8 { Hastening to bring the queen over to the danger zone. If Black tries to stop the pawn’s advance by 32...h5 then the queen works her way in by 33 Qg5 (threatening 34 Qxh5+) 33...Kg8 34 Qh6 and 35 Qg7#. } 33. h5 { Concentrating his fire on a vulnerable spot. } 33... Qg8 { Not 33...Be8, which protects the pawn but blocks the queen. The queen is the only piece agile enough to defend against White’s attack as it shifts from one point to another. } 34. Rd4 { White makes use of all his resources. The rook will take part by switching over either to the h-file or the g-file. } 34... Be8 { The bishop helps defend the g-pawn so that the queen is free to protect the h-pawn, White’s next target of attack. } 35. Rh4 { Revealing the plan: mate in three by 36 hxg6+ fxg6 37 Rxh6+ Kxh6 38 Qh4#. } 35... Qf8 { The only possible defence. } 36. Rg4 { A pretty manoeuvre! White’s last move lured the queen away from the g-pawn. Now that this pawn has one piece less defending it, White attacks it with a fourth piece, the rook. } 36... Qg8 { The queen rushes back to defend. } 37. Qe3! { The threat on the rook gains time for White’s real purpose, an attack on the h-pawn at the other side of the board. } 37... Rd7 { The rook flees but cannot get over to help defend the king. } 38. Rh4 { Renews (and shortens) the earlier threat: 39 hxg6+ fxg6 40 Qxh6#. } 38... Qf8 { Once again, the queen shifts over to protect the h-pawn. } 39. g4! { Bringing up the infantry! White throws everything into the attack and now threatens 40 g5 followed by 41 hxg6+ fxg6 42 Rxh6+ Kg8 43 Qh3, with an easy win. If after 40 g5, Black tries 40...hxg5 then 41 hxg6++ Kg8 42 Rh8+ Kxh8 43 Qh3+ forces mate. } 39... Kh8 { Black unpins the g-pawn and prepares 40...g5 41 Qe4 Qg8, when White will have trouble breaking through the defence. } 40. hxg6 { Tearing apart the cordon of pawns guarding the king. } 40... fxg6 { This capture is the lesser evil, as otherwise White’s next move, 41 g7+, is fatal. } 41. Rxh6+ { Killing off another bodyguard. } 41... Rh7 { If 41...Kg8, then 42 Qh3, doubling pieces on the open file, is conclusive. } 42. Rxh7+ { Certainly not 42 g5 Rxh6+ 43 gxh6, when the h-file is closed and useless to White. } 42... Kxh7 { White is only one pawn up, but his attack has lost none of its virulence. } 43. Qg5 { Now White plans to penetrate by 44 Qh5+ (exploiting the plight of the pinned g-pawn) 44...Kg8 45 Bxg6, and the last barrier is destroyed. } 43... Qf7 { Black avoids a queen exchange, as 43...Qh6+ 44 Qxh6+ Kxh6 45 f7 Bxf7 46 d7 results in White getting a new queen. } 44. Qh5+ { Beginning of the final movement! } 44... Kg8 { The king is driven back and the g-pawn loses a protector. } 45. Bxg6 { White sacrifices a piece to bring about a position where the passed pawns will decide the issue. } 45... Qxg6 { An attempt to counterattack by 45...Qb7+ is futile. White simply replies 46 Kh2 and the king, seemingly exposed, is not in the slightest danger. White wins as 46...Bxg6 fails to 47 d7. The whole game is a marvellous blend of clear-cut positional play and ingenuity in attack. The opening is sound and simple, the middlegame is a lesson in attacking technique, and the ending is artistic. } 46. Qxg6+ { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0

1. e4 { Regarded objectively, 1 e4 is one of the strongest possible opening moves. It establishes a pawn in the centre and permits two pieces to come into play. More could hardly be asked of one move. } 1... c5 { This opening, the Sicilian Defence, is currently one of the most popular openings. Black’s first move has the defect that only one piece is released, but in one respect it has a similar aim to 1...e5: it covers d4 and so makes it more awkward for White to form a ‘two-abreast’ pawn-centre by playing d4. If White insists on d4, then Black can reply ...cxd4, thereby exchanging White’s central pawn for a less central one. The Sicilian Defence is perfectly sound and leads to a fighting game in which Black has many counterattacking chances, especially against an over-ambitious opponent, too intent on a kingside attack. Black aims at queenside counterattack, and for this, control of the cfile is essential to offset White’s superiority in the centre and on the kingside. } 2. Nc3 { A normal developing move. White brings a piece to a square where it exerts influence on the centre – but what a placid move this is! More to the point is the energetic 2 Nf3. This develops a piece on the kingside (facilitating early castling) and prepares 3 d4 – action in the centre and release of the queenside pieces. } 2... e6 { Black’s move is quiet but effective! Diagonals are opened for the f8-bishop and the queen, and preparation is made to occupy the centre, if appropriate, with 3...d5. } 3. Nf3 { This excellent move places the knight at once on its most suitable square, increases the pressure on the centre, and makes early kingside castling feasible. Playing 3 d4 instead leads to 3...cxd4 4 Qxd4 Nc6, when Black gains a tempo by the attack on the queen. } 3... Nc6 { If Black plays 3...d5, then the reply 4 exd5 exd5 5 d4 opens lines to the advantage of the better developed player – in this case White, who has two pieces out to Black’s none. } 4. d4 { The characteristic break in the Sicilian, by means of which the mobility of White’s pieces is increased. A diagonal is opened up for the c1-bishop, while the queen gets some more air. } 4... cxd4 { Black exchanges to kill off one of the two centre pawns in return for his c-pawn. Meanwhile, he opens the all-important c-file for the use of his queen and a8-rook. } 5. Nxd4 { The recapture centralizes White’s knight and increases the attacking range of White’s pieces. } 5... Nf6 { By a devious route, the players have arrived at the Four Knights Sicilian, a tricky variation in spite of its classical appearance. What should White play now? The choice is more a matter of style, mood and temperament than anything else – and this is what makes chess so fascinating. White can decide to be methodical and stick to straightforward development by 6 Be3 or 6 Be2. He can be bold and combinative with 6 Ndb5, or cautious with 6 a3, preventing a powerful pin. He can be patient and devote his efforts to trying to build up a positional advantage after 6 g3 or 6 Nxc6. Whatever he does, the play will reflect something of his own personality. The way he directs the activities of his small army will mirror the thoughts, moods, and instincts of the individual. } 6. Nxc6 { White is content with the slight positional advantage that results from the exchange of knights. Let us take a quick look at some of the alternatives: 1) 6 Be3 Bb4 (pinning the knight and threatening 7...Nxe4) 7 Bd3 d5! and Black has overcome all his difficulties. 2) The quiet 6 Be2 (certainly not 6 Bd3, leaving the knight en prise ) is also met by 6...Bb4 with good counterplay. 3) Preventing the pin by 6 a3 is not attractive. It is answered by 6...d5, and White must fight to retain the initiative. Time is too valuable in the opening to waste on pawn moves. 4) The double-edged 6 Ndb5 is not to everybody’s taste, leading as it does to wild complications after 6...Bb4 7 Bf4 Nxe4 8 Nc7+ Kf8 9 Qf3 d5 10 O-O-O or the sharp Pelikan variation after 6...d6 7 Bf4 e5 8 Bg5. One merit of the text-move is that Black, in recapturing with a pawn, closes the c-file, his chief avenue of attack in the Sicilian. } 6... bxc6 { This is superior to 6...dxc6; for one thing, it is usually better strategy to capture toward the centre. In this case, it keeps a cluster of pawns in the centre and opens the b-file for the benefit of the a8-rook. The continuation after 6...dxc6 might be 7 Qxd8+ Kxd8 8 Bg5 Be7 9 O-O-O+ and Black is kept on the move. } 7. e5 { Not only does this evict the f6-knight from its fine post, but it also strengthens White’s grip on the d6-square. } 7... Nd5 { Little thought would have been required to make this centralizing move. The only other spot available to the knight was g8, home base. } 8. Ne4 { Exchanging knights would forfeit any advantage White enjoys. The move actually made intensifies the pressure on d6. } 8... f5 { No loitering on the premises! Either the knight leaves or it declares its intentions! Black had another defence in 8...Qc7 9 f4 Qb6, aiming to prevent White from castling kingside. } 9. exf6 { The knight must stay where it is for White to carry out his purpose, which is to take possession of the critical d6-square. } 9... Nxf6 { Black does not take with the pawn, as that is answered by 10 Qh5+. This would force his king to move and thereby deprive him of the privilege of castling. } 10. Nd6+ { Compelling an exchange of pieces which leaves Black with a ‘bad’ bishop, one which is ineffective because of the pawns standing on squares of the same colour as the bishop. A bishop can accomplish little if its pathway is cluttered up by pawns. } 10... Bxd6 { The only other move, 10...Ke7, is not inviting. } 11. Qxd6 { The recapture gives White a stranglehold on his opponent’s position. Not only does White blockade the d-pawn, preventing the freeing ...d5 advance, but he also enables his king to flee to safety by castling. In addition, White exerts a great deal of pressure on the dark squares, a pressure that is accentuated by the fact that Black’s king’s bishop, operating on those squares, is off the board. } 11... Ne4 { The queen must be driven off quickly, or Black will choke for lack of air. There is no relief in 11...Qe7 12 Bf4 Qxd6 13 Bxd6 Ne4 14 Ba3!, when White still bears down with a heavy hand. } 12. Qd4 { In retreating, the queen manages to attack in two directions, threatening both the knight and the enemy g-pawn. } 12... Nf6 { The only move to parry both the threats. } 13. Qd6 { White tries again, as he hates to relinquish this dominating position. Meanwhile, he hints that he can always draw if he wants to, by a repetition of moves. } 13... Ne4 { Black cannot let the queen stay at d6, and delay in evicting her might prove to be fatal. That Black’s difficulties are not insuperable was demonstrated by Alekhine, who suggested this continuation: 13...Qb6 (Black threatens 14...Qxf2+ 15 Kxf2 Ne4+) 14 Bd3 c5 15 Bf4 Bb7 16 O-O Rc8. } 14. Qb4! { Very strong! If the queen cannot establish permanent residence at d6, this square is the next best thing. At b4 (odd place though it is) the queen attacks the knight, controls a diagonal which makes castling for Black impossible, and in a third direction prevents Black’s a8-rook from seizing the open b-file. } 14... d5 { Black protects his knight and prepares to challenge White’s queen by 15...Qd6. Black’s pawn-centre provides some compensation for his troubles. } 15. Bd3 { An ideal move, as a piece develops with a threat – 16 Bxe4 dxe4 17 Qxe4 winning a pawn. } 15... Qd6 { Black offers to exchange, which will either rid the board of White’s attacking queen or induce her to retreat from a dominating position. } 16. Qxd6 { White is willing to simplify. He will still have advantages in his two powerful bishops and an enduring grip on the dark squares. } 16... Nxd6 { Black is content with his part of the bargain: both his rooks have open files on which to operate, and he has a group of pawns in the centre with which he expects to limit the scope of the bishops. } 17. f4! { “An eye for the microscopic betokens the master,” says the great Marco. The e5-square is now controlled by White, while Black’s e-pawn is restrained from advancing. One effect of this pawn’s inability to move is that it fearfully circumscribes the mobility of Black’s bishop. } 17... a5 { Black must do something about getting the bishop into play. With this move he plans to develop it at a6 and exchange it for White’s more powerful bishop. } 18. Be3! { Excellent! This holds back Black’s c-pawn, while two more dark squares, d4 and c5, come under White’s domination. } 18... Ba6 { With this move Black hopes to clear the board of one of White’s menacing bishops. } 19. Kd2! { The king is a strong piece and should be used aggressively in the ending. As the number of pieces on the board decreases, so is the danger of the king being exposed to a mating attack reduced, and its own power as a fighting piece magnified. In the ending, the king is unexcelled as a means of causing damage by getting in among the enemy’s pawns. That is why, in the present position, the king comes closer to the centre, where he is most useful, instead of castling and then working his way there. } 19... Nc4+ { Black’s plan becomes manifest: he wants to force an exchange of knight for bishop. This would leave bishops commanding squares of different colours on the board, which often exerts a drawish influence on the game. Another alternative worth considering was 19...Nb7 in order to play 20...c5 and get his central pawn phalanx rolling. } 20. Bxc4 { Practically forced, as Black was attacking both e3 and b2. } 20... Bxc4 { Let us size up the situation: the white bishop enjoys far more freedom than does Black’s. The latter is greatly hampered in its movements by the many pawns standing on light squares, the colour of the squares on which the bishop operates. White’s king, being nearer the centre and the critical squares d4 and e5, is much better situated for the endgame than Black’s. Black’s centre, the heart of his game, is held fast. The three pawns he has in that area are fixed and unable to move. } 21. a4! { Blockade! The a5-pawn is stopped dead in its tracks; it is now a fixed target, always in danger of being attacked by Bb6. In order to make sure it is not captured (for its removal gives White a passed a-pawn) Black must watch over it constantly with his a8-rook. Because of the need to guard this one pawn, Black is thereby deprived of the services of a rook. } 21... Kd7 { Black brings his king toward the centre for the endgame. The rooks are now united, while the king himself heads for d6, where he hopes to support an advance by the e-pawn or the c-pawn. } 22. b3 { White attacks the bishop to force it to the side of the board. You will note that the bishop’s scope is cut down as pawns on both sides are placed on light squares, the colour of the diagonals on which the bishop must travel. } 22... Ba6 { The only flight square open to the unhappy bishop! } 23. Bb6! { And now an attack on the pawn... } 23... Bc8 { ...which can only be met by further retreat! } 24. Ke3 { Continuing the trek to d4, e5, and, as we shall see, all points north! 24 Bc5 was a bit more cruel, to prevent any demonstration by 24...Rf8 . } 24... Ra6 { No better was 24...Kd6 to back up a pawn push, as the reply 25 Kd4 nips that little idea in the bud. Black’s best chance was with 24...Rf8, to get some counterplay by getting his h8-rook into the game by way of the open file. The move he does make attacks the bishop and succeeds in its object of driving it away from a good square – but only on to a better one! } 25. Bc5! { White dominates every important square on the board! The bishop stops the h8-rook from getting to f8, the a6-rook from moving to b6, the king from d6, the d-pawn from advancing and the c-pawn from moving at all! Compare its control of eight squares with that of Black’s bishop, whose influence is confined to one square! This difference in their potential accounts in great measure for the extent of White’s attacking opportunities, and for the consequent difficulty Black will have in defending. Every gain or control of territory by White will result in more and more cramping of Black’s position. } 25... Kc7 { Stepping aside, the king makes the d7-square accessible to the black bishop. } 26. Kd4! { Tightening the noose! This king also makes way – for the benefit of the h1-rook, who will turn the e-file to account. } 26... Bd7 { Black will try to manoeuvre the bishop over to the kingside, for instance to g6. His h8-rook seems to have a great deal of scope, but what does it avail him? If it moves to b8 (as good a file as there is) at what point can it penetrate? It cannot get to any useful square on that file. } 27. Rhe1 { Much stronger than the immediate occupation of e5 by the king. White intends to use this key square as a transfer point for his rook on its way to the g-file. After it gets there, White will settle his king at e5 and tighten his grip on the dark squares. } 27... h5 { Black prepares a pawn barricade against the rook’s threatened attack on the kingside. } 28. Re5 { Second stop on the trip to g5. } 28... g6 { Battening down the hatches, Black gets ready for a hard winter. } 29. Rg5 { White attacks the g-pawn and simultaneously makes room for his king. } 29... Rg8 { The pawn must be protected, and this of course is more elastic than 29...Rh6, when the rook has no mobility to speak of. } 30. Ke5 { Further penetration along the convenient dark squares. The threat is 31 Kf6 Be8 32 Re1 (even stronger than 32 Kxe6), followed by 33 Rxe6. } 30... Be8 { Black abandons the e-pawn, as he cannot hope to save all his pawns. There is a slight chance, if White captures the pawn at once, 31 Kxe6, of putting up some resistance by 31...Bd7+ 32 Kf6 Bf5. Black’s pitiable bishop is sadly hemmed in by the five pawns firmly fixed on squares of the same colour. } 31. Re1 { Before committing himself to decisive action, White applies more pressure. Notice how a master player puts every piece to work before he strikes a blow. } 31... Ra8 { To get back into the game, this rook has to return home! There was no satisfactory defence in 31 ... Kd7 as the reply 32 Kf6 uncovers the rook’s attack on the e-pawn. } 32. Kf6! { White completes the plan of encirclement. Notice the effects of the arrangement of Black’s pawns at e6, d5 and c6 – Black’s own pieces are kept under restraint, while White’s can utilize the weakened dark squares c5, d4, e5 and f6 to penetrate into the vitals of the enemy position. Notice also that these dark squares are ‘holes’, squares from which pieces cannot be dislodged by the opponent’s pawns. White does not resort to brutal attack or to intricate combination to accomplish his purpose but puts his trust in the dynamic power inherent in an overwhelming positional superiority. } 32... Bd7 { Black reveals another reason for his previous move. In the continuation 33 Rxg6 Rxg6+ 34 Kxg6 Rg8+ 35 Kxh5 Rxg2, Black suddenly turns on his foe. } 33. g3 { To guard against this possibility, and to lessen any chance of a breakthrough by one of Black’s rooks, White fashions a chain of pawns on the kingside. } 33... Rae8 { Black can do nothing to improve his position, so this amounts to no more than a waiting move. } 34. Ree5 { White could play 34 Rxg6 and have little trouble winning, but he makes doubly sure. He blockades the e-pawn first, to quell even a shadow of resistance! } 34... Rh8 { “While there’s life...” } 35. Rxg6 { The first tangible gain. The rest is an interesting display of the art of winning a won game. } 35... Rh7 { Fearing threats against his isolated h-pawn, Black prepares to double rooks on the h-file in an attempt to save it. } 36. Rg7 { White keeps on gaining ground. Now he invades the seventh rank. } 36... Reh8 { Black holds on grimly. } 37. Rxh7 { Simplest, hence the scientific way to force the win. In endings where one side has a material advantage, the prescribed strategy is to exchange pieces, not pawns, and to bring it down to a pawn ending. Endings with only pawns on the board are the easiest to win. } 37... Rxh7 { The recapture leaves Black only a pawn down – for the time being! } 38. Kg6! { With every exchange, the king’s power increases! Now the king threatens the rook and helps attack the h-pawn. } 38... Rh8 { Strangely enough, the rook has only one move on the board! Does White now settle the issue by removing the h-pawn? } 39. Kg7! { No, no, a thousand times no! If 39 Rxh5? then 39 ...Be8+, when Black wins a whole rook and the game. How easy it is to go wrong even in a simple ending! White’s actual move first banishes the rook from the premises. } 39... Rd8 { The rook must leave the file, abandoning the pawn. } 40. Rxh5 { Now the capture is safe. } 40... Be8 { Hoping to bring the bishop over to the kingside and then attack White’s queenside pawns. } 41. Rh7 { The rook hastens to the seventh rank, a rook’s proper post in the ending. } 41... Rd7+ { Otherwise, White’s procedure is 42 Kf6+ Bd7 43 g4, and the pawn cannot be stopped. } 42. Kh6 { The king must stay within range of his rook. } 42... Rxh7+ { The exchange of rooks cannot be avoided, so Black captures first to draw White’s king away from h5. If the bishop can get there, it might still stir up some trouble. } 43. Kxh7 { This meets with White’s approval. His kingside pawns are mobile, while Black’s pawns either cannot or dare not make a move. } 43... Bh5 { Now to get behind the queenside pawns! } 44. h4 { The queenside pawns cannot be rescued, so White starts his kingside pawns rolling. } 44... Bd1 { After so much inactivity, this bishop not only threatens the lives of all the pawns on light squares but restrains (for the time being) all the pawns on the kingside. } 45. c3! { To save itself, this pawn flees to a dark square. } 45... Bxb3 { Black takes a pawn, more to distract White than anything else, since he has no real threats. } 46. g4 { Ready to refute 46...Bxa4 with 47 f5 Kd7 (after 47 ...Bc2 48 Kg6 the h-pawn walks up, or 47...e5 48 f6 Kd7 49 f7, and White wins) 48 f6 Ke8, and 49 Kg7 escorts the pawn through. } 46... Kd7 { The king rushes over to hold back the pawns. } 47. g5 { “The passed pawn’s lust to expand”, as Nimzowitsch puts it. } 47... e5 { Desperation, but there is no promising defence. If 47...Ke8, then 48 g6 Bc2 49 h5 Bf5 50 Kg7 wins for White. } 48. f5 { The simplest. White’s three connected passed pawns should be convincing enough. } 48... Bxa4 { After 48 ...Bc2, 49 Kg6 is the clincher, protecting the f-pawn and making way for the h-pawn. } 49. f6 { Indicating that it’s time to concede. The pawn cannot be stopped by 49 ...Ke8 as 50 Kg7 sees it through. A beautiful illustration of the technique of exploiting weaknesses on the dark squares. } 1-0

1. d4 { This move, more than any other, offers chances of an opening advantage without taking risks. Two pieces are released at once, and a pawn occupies a central square, as with 1 e4, but extra benefits accrue from 1 d4: } 1... d5 { The simplest way to prevent White from dominating the centre with 2 e4 next move. } 2. c4 { The characteristic move of the Queen’s Gambit. The versatile c-pawn does many things. Three of these things are concerned with doing away with Black’s centre: Besides all this, the move of the c-pawn assures that the c-file is kept free and clear for the convenience of White’s major pieces, while a pathway is opened for the queen, leading to the queenside. } 2... e6 { Black strengthens the position of his centre pawn. In the event that White plays 3 cxd5, he is ready to recapture with a pawn and thus maintain a pawn in the centre of the board. This is Black’s safest defence, even though it does limit the scope of his c8-bishop. } 3. Nf3 { This is an excellent move, though not so sharp as 3 Nc3, which adds pressure to the attack on Black’s d-pawn. Either move complies with an injunction particularly applicable in queen’s pawn openings: Develop all the pieces as quickly as possible! “The main principle in the openings,” says Capablanca, “is rapid and efficient development .” (The italics are his.) } 3... Nf6 { Black’s knight moves in toward the centre, attacks the e4-square and adds its weight to the protection of d5. It is good policy to mobilize the kingside pieces first, since only two of them need be developed to make castling possible. } 4. Bg5 { A powerful move! The bishop is developed and a restraining hand is put on the enemy knight. There is no immediate threat in the move – White just ‘threatens to threaten’. } 4... Be7 { The proper way to unpin a knight. The inexperienced player often grows impatient and drives the bishop off by 4...h6 5 Bh4 g5 6 Bg3 only to find that he has ruined the pawn position on the kingside as a result of his violent action. } 5. e3 { White strengthens his pawn-centre and frees the light-squared bishop for action. } 5... O-O { Black gets his king into safety before revealing his plans for the development of the queenside pieces. His b8-knight may go to d7, or following an attack on White’s centre, perhaps to c6. } 6. Nc3 { White has no such problems. His queen’s knight can move to c3, since it does not obstruct the c-pawn and the opening of the c-file. At c3 the knight takes an active part in the struggle for control of the centre. } 6... Nbd7 { This knight must never be developed at c6 before the c-pawn is moved. The pawn must be free, either to advance to c5 and fight for equal rights in the centre or to move one square to c6 where it bolsters Black’s own centre. But the pawn must not be obstructed by ... Nc6! The development by 6...Nbd7 is stronger than appears at first glance. Black’s position is cramped for the moment, but the knight is ready to support a liberating movement and an attack on White’s centre by ...c5 or ...e5. } 7. Qc2 { A magnificent square for White’s queen! From c2, the queen exerts her powerful influence in several directions: on the partly open c-file and on the centre, preventing Black from freeing himself by 7...Ne4. This attempt to force some exchanges and shake off the pressure is refuted by (after 7...Ne4) 8 Bxe7 Qxe7 9 cxd5 Nxc3 (if 9...exd5, then 10 Nxd5 wins on the spot) 10 Qxc3 exd5 11 Qxc7 Qb4+ 12 Qc3, and White has won a pawn. Another feature of 7 Qc2 is that it vacates d1 for the queen’s rook, whose presence on the same file as Black’s queen will discourage the opponent from making a break in the centre. Exchanges of pawns in the centre would clear away some of the obstructions and intensify the rook’s pressure on the file – a pressure which reaches all the way up the file to the queen. } 7... c6 { This move provides solid support to the centre pawn and gives the queen access to the queenside. It looks substantial enough, but the more aggressive 7...c5, disputing control of the centre by establishing a state of tension there, might be more to the point. The danger in delaying ...c5 is that Black may never again have a favourable opportunity to get in this thrust. } 8. Bd3 { White develops a fifth piece, pointing it at Black’s kingside, and is ready to castle instantly on either wing. } 8... dxc4 { Black waited for White to move his f1-bishop before making this capture. Otherwise, the bishop recaptures and develops at the same time. Black’s intention, in clearing d5, is to swing his knight over to that square, force some exchanges, and free his cramped position. Nevertheless, Black has surrendered the pawn-centre, which he so carefully built up. } 9. Bxc4 { White is content with the result of the pawn exchange. Lines are opened which increase the mobility of his pieces. } 9... Nd5 { Obviously to compel White to exchange bishops. } 10. Bxe7 { This is safer than 10 Bf4 Nxf4 11 exf4, when White is left with an isolated d-pawn. The pawn itself is in no great danger, but the d5-square, directly in front of it, is! It is in danger of being occupied indefinitely by one of Black’s pieces. A piece stationed on a square in front of an isolated pawn can never be driven off by enemy pawns. } 10... Qxe7 { The proper recapture, letting the queen come into play; taking with the knight would be developing backwards. } 11. O-O { The king finds a safer shelter while the rooks get in touch with each other. White’s position is excellent, the result of simple straightforward development. } 11... b5 { A shot at the bishop, to force its retreat. Meanwhile, Black gains time for the development of his own bishop. } 12. Be2 { The bishop withdraws – but not to d3, where an attack by 12 ...Nb4 enables Black to bring about an exchange of knight for bishop. White wants to preserve the bishop, which has excellent prospects for attack when it emerges later at d3 or f3. [Editor’s Note: 12 Nxd5 exd5 13 Bd3 wins an important pawn for nothing – brutal but effective.] } 12... a6 { The usual manoeuvre of protecting the b-pawn, so that the c-pawn is free to attack White’s centre. If Black can get in 13...c5 he will still have a respectable game. } 13. Ne4! { Uncovering an attack! The queen threatens the c-pawn, while the knight restrains it from advancing to c5. White’s idea is to prevent the indispensable freeing move ...c5 forever and then barricade Black completely by planting a piece at c5. } 13... Bb7 { Black protects the pawn by developing another piece. } 14. Ne5! { Very fine strategy! Before settling a piece on c5, White plays to get rid of one of the guardians of that square, Black’s knight at d7. If he plays 14 Nc5 at once, then 14 ...Nxc5 15 Qxc5 Qxc5 16 dxc5 leaves him with a pawn occupying c5. This does not have the same effect as a piece standing on that square. A pawn is immobile and does little to restrain the opponent, but a piece radiates power in all directions and has a terribly cramping effect on the enemy’s movements in the whole surrounding area. } 14... Rac8 { Developing another piece and defending the pawn which was attacked by two pieces. Black did not care for the exchange 14...Nxe5 15 dxe5. White could then anchor his remaining knight at d6, follow up by planting his queen at c5, and throttle Black thoroughly. } 15. Nxd7 { Removing one of the pieces guarding the vital c5-square... } 15... Qxd7 { ...and luring the other one away! } 16. Nc5! { With the domination of this square, White’s advantage is decisive in the strategic sense. What remains is to exploit his superior position, to translate it into actual victory, and this process of consummating the win is one of the most fascinating parts of chess. } 16... Qc7 { Both queen and bishop were attacked, so the queen stays near the bishop. } 17. Rfd1 { The practice of the masters has shown that rooks are most efficient when they control open files. Suppose there are no open files? Then the rooks should be placed on partly open files, or on files likely to be opened. Suppose none of those seem to exist? Then the rooks should be brought to the centre, to exert pressure on the centre files. But the rooks must be developed! } 17... Rcd8 { There are various reasons for this move: The rook has no future on the c-file while the pawn at c6 impedes its movements (and there is little prospect of the pawn coming to life). The rook vacates c8 for the bishop. The bishop cannot stay indefinitely at b7, where it is hampered by the c-pawn, and where the queen is tied down to its defence. } 18. Rac1 { White’s incidental threat of winning a pawn by 19 Nxb7 Qxb7 20 Qxc6 is subordinate to the strategic concept of intensifying the pressure on the c-file. } 18... Bc8 { Black parries the threat of 19 Nxb7 and frees his queen from the job of watching over the bishop. Now he can speculate on getting some counterplay by the break 19...e5. } 19. Qe4! { Magnificent centralization by the queen, who prevents 19...e5 (when that pawn would be simply snapped up) and prepares to switch over for a kingside attack. } 19... Nf6 { The knight, best defender of the castled position, returns to f6, incidentally with an attack on the queen. Against other moves White could play 20 Bd3, threatening 21 Qxh7#. This would compel either a retreat by the knight or a weakening advance of one of Black’s kingside pawns. } 20. Qh4 { The queen evades the knight’s threat and swings over to the kingside to get an attack rolling against the king. } 20... Qa5 { Black tries counterattack on the queenside – mostly to distract his opponent’s attention. There is little he can do to strengthen the defence of his kingside. Any move of a pawn only loosens the position and reduces his chances of resistance. The break in the centre by 20...e5, which he contemplated making, is risky, to say the least, as 21 Qg3 in reply, pinning the pawn, is troublesome. } 21. a3 { The simplest way to save the a-pawn and to keep the queen from moving to b4. } 21... b4 { Hoping to disrupt White’s queenside by continuing with 22...bxa3. } 22. a4 { White avoids any exchanges that might let the queen set foot in his territory. } 22... Nd7 { Trying to shake off the grip of the knight, which is strangling his queenside to death. If he waits too long, White pursues his attack with 23 Bd3, followed by 24 g4 (to dislodge the knight which guards against mate). After the compulsory reply 24...h6, White plays 25 g5, forcing an exchange of pawns which opens the g-file. White can then shift his king to h1 and swing a rook over to attack on the open file. Against this, Black could not hold out very long. } 23. b3 { Defending the a-pawn, and so relieving the knight of that task. } 23... Nxc5 { There is hardly anything better. The tempting 23...e5 succumbs to 24 Nxd7 Bxd7 25 Rc5 Qc7 26 Rxe5, when White has won a pawn. } 24. Rxc5 { The exchange of knights results in White’s substituting another piece at c5, maintaining his grip on the position. } 24... Qb6 { Preferable to 24...Qc7, when the attack might proceed thus: 25 Rdc1 Bb7 (to protect both the c-pawn and the a-pawn) 26 a5 (to isolate the b-pawn by preventing 26...a5), and White follows up by 27 R1c4 and 28 Rxb4. } 25. Rdc1 { Doubling rooks on an open file more than doubles the pressure on the file (and on the opponent). White’s immediate threat is 26 Rxc6. } 25... Bb7 { The bishop guards both lightsquared pawns, but its mobility is almost nil. The subject of mobility is interesting. While it is not always true that the player whose pieces have more room in which to manoeuvre enjoys an advantage, it applies often enough in practice for us to disregard the exceptional cases. It stands to reason that pieces that are free and untrammelled not only have more striking power in the portion of the board they occupy, but they also control and limit the activities of the enemy. Add to this the ease with which they can reach other parts of the board, and you can see the advantages to be derived from the ability to move freely about. Let us compare all the moves the pieces on each side can make. We are not evaluating their worth, whether good, bad or indifferent. What we want to see is the range of their action. White’s pieces are 250% as efficient as Black’s! With so great a disparity in mobility (and consequently in attacking force) how long can Black continue the struggle? } 26. a5 { In order to isolate Black’s b-pawn, and incidentally drive the queen back to the second rank. } 26... Qa7 { On the alternative 26...Qc7 White can either resume operations on the kingside or go after a pawn on the queenside by 27 Bf3 Rd6 28 R1c4 followed by 29 Rxb4. Winning the pawn will not diminish the force of White’s attack or loosen his grip on the position. } 27. Bd3! { Now that the queenside is fixed, White turns his attention to the kingside and threatens mate on the move. Black can easily dispose of this threat, but only by moving one of the pawns near his king and thereby creating a weakness which is organic, permanent and irremediable! } 27... g6 { If 27...h6, then 28 Qe4 forces 28...g6, when two pawns have been uprooted. White could then continue by 29 Rh5 Kg7 (if 29...gxh5, then 30 Qh7#, or if 29...Kh7, then 30 Qf4 wins) 30 Qe5+ f6 (or 30...Kh7, when the neat double pin 31 Qg5 wins) 31 Qg3 g5 (if 31...f5, then 32 Qe5+ Kh7 33 Qc7+ Kg8 34 Rxh6 wins) 32 Rxh6! Kxh6 33 Qh3+ Kg7 34 Qh7#. A simpler way, if White doesn’t want to bother analysing combinations, is to maintain the pressure and then apply more! For instance, after 27...h6 28 Qe4 g6, instead of playing 29 Rh5 White could advance 29 h4, threatening to break up the pawns by 30 h5. If Black replies 29...h5 to stop the advance, White can either snap the h-pawn off with his rook or keep hammering away by 30 g4 hxg4 31 h5. After the actual move, Black has weaknesses on the dark squares and holes in his position. } 28. Qf6! { The queen plants herself securely in one of the holes created by Black’s ...g6 advance. A hole is an unguarded square such as f6 or h6 brought into being by the advance of a nearby pawn. It is a weak square, because it is no longer under the surveillance of a pawn and is vulnerable to invasion by an enemy piece. Such a piece can settle itself comfortably in one of these holes, secure in the knowledge that no enemy pawn can disturb it. White’s plan, now that the queen has worked her way into a dominating position on the kingside, is classical in its simplicity: he will just advance the h-pawn to h4, h5 and h6, and then play Qg7#. If, after the pawn reaches h5, it is captured en route, then mate by the rook is the instant punishment. } 28... Rd6 { Black vacates d8, so that his queen can return to that square and challenge White’s. In chess language: if 29 h4 Qa8 30 h5 Qd8, White’s queen must leave f6 and forego the threat of mate. } 29. Qe7 { An attack on the exposed rook, so that Black will have his hands full warding off the accumulating threats. Black has three problems, each on a different part of the board: 1) on the kingside, he must guard against being mated; 2) on the queenside, he must release himself from White’s stranglehold; 3) in the middle, he must rescue any pieces that are loose. } 29... Rfd8 { If instead 29...Qb8, 30 Be4 Rc8 31 h4 Qc7 32 Qf6 Qd8 33 Qxd8+ followed by either 34 Bxc6 or 34 R1c4, with an easy, routine win. } 30. h4 { White is still aiming for mate by h5, h6 and Qf6. } 30... R8d7 { The queen must be evicted. Black does not play 30...R6d7 as he wants the first rank and the d8-square available to his own queen. } 31. Qf6 { The danger of mate becomes more acute! } 31... Qa8 { Only by a retreat can Black’s queen rush to the rescue! If Black tries 31...Rd5 to stop 32 h5, White effects the advance by first dislodging the rook with 32 Be4. } 32. Be4! { Not at once 32 h5 because of 32...Qd8 in reply. After the text-move (which incidentally prevents 32...Rd5) White can meet 32...Qd8 by exchanging queens and taking the c-pawn, winning easily if prosaically. } 32... Qe8 { Hoping to lure White into the premature 33 Bxc6, when 33...Bxc6 34 Rxc6 Rxc6 35 Rxc6 Rxd4 regains the pawn and gives him fighting chances. } 33. h5! { Each step the pawn makes increases the danger to Black’s king. The pawn is headed for h6, where it will settle itself firmly in the other hole in Black’s position. } 33... Rd8 { The rook withdraws, so that the c-pawn may have the added protection of the queen. The fact that Black is kept busy warding off threats on both sides of the board is the clue to the next move, which presents Black with an insoluble problem (the hardest kind to face). } 34. Bxc6! { Removing a pawn that is apparently adequately protected. As will be seen, though, one of its defenders is overworked. The queen not only has to guard this point (c6) and the rook at d8, but must also keep an eye out for mate threats on the king. } 34... Bxc6 { Black must take the bishop or lose some material, since two pieces are attacked. } 35. h6! { A zwischenzug, an in-between move, that threatens instant mate. } 35... Kf8 { On the alternative defence by 35...Qf8 the win is forced with 36 Rxc6 (threatening 37 Rxd6 Rxd6 38 Rc8 Qxc8 39 Qg7#) 36...Qxh6 37 Rxd6 Rxd6 38 Rc8+ and Black must give up his queen. } 36. Rxc6 { White has regained his piece and now threatens 37 Rxd6 Rxd6 38 Rc8 Qxc8 39 Qh8+, winning the queen. } 36... Rxc6 { There is not much choice: if Black plays 36...Qd7 (to meet 37 Rxd6 with 37...Qxd6), then 37 Rc7 Qe8 38 Qg7#. } 37. Rxc6 { White gets his rook back and prepares to seize the seventh rank by 38 Rc7. This would keep the king from escaping and again threaten him with mate by the queen. } 37... Rd7 { There is no relief in 37...Qxc6, as White forces a winning ending by 38 Qxd8+ Qe8 39 Qd6+ Kg8 40 Qxa6 Qe7 (otherwise 41 Qb7 wins at once) 41 Qb6 and the passed pawn cannot be stopped. } 38. Rc8! { Attacking the queen with his unprotected rook. A pretty enough conclusion, but pedants may point out that White missed a brilliancy in 38 Qg7+ Ke7 39 Rxe6+! Kxe6 40 Qe5#. Many a player has had quicker wins or more artistic ones than actually occurred pointed out to him by lesser lights, who revel in the fact that they found something the master overlooked. The reason the master didn’t see the shorter line is that he was not looking for it in the first place! The move with which he wins is the one whose effects he foresaw earlier and analysed thoroughly before starting his final combination. Once the series of forcing moves clicks, there is no reason at all for him to waste time finding other moves that might win. It takes time to analyse combinations, and the shorter way, ventured on hurriedly, might turn out to have a hole in it. The moral is: play the move that forces the win in the simplest way and leave the brilliancies to Alekhine and Keres. } 38... Qxc8 { Naturally, 38...Rd8 39 Rxd8 does not help matters. Winning the queen and the game. Magnificent play by White, who never once relaxed his iron control of the game. A remarkable feature is the circumstance that none of Black’s pieces or pawns, with the exception of the one brave little pawn at b4, ever crossed the fourth rank into White’s side of the board! } 39. Qh8+ { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0

1. e4 { In his delightful book Chess for Winter Evenings, written more than 140 years ago, H.R. Agnel proposed an interesting argument for the superiority of 1 e4 to 1 d4: “Moving the d-pawn two squares,” he said, “gives the queen a range of two squares and the c1-bishop a range of five squares. But moving 1 e4 gives a range of four squares to the queen and five squares to the f1-bishop. You see therefore that e-pawn two squares is the most desirable move with which to open the game. There is another reason why this move is desirable – the pawn occupies a portion of the centre of the board. Two pawns abreast at your e4- and d4-squares, supported by pawns and pieces, must be considered as your best military position, and maintained with all the skill in your power.” } 1... d5 { With his very first move, Black tries to uproot White’s stake in the centre. Black is willing to take some risks for the sake of having the initiative. There is danger in the fact that his queen, in recapturing, will come into the game too soon and be chased around the board by White’s minor pieces. } 2. exd5 { Simplest, and keeps Black on his toes. The alternatives 2 e5 and 2 Nc3 are tame and cause Black no trouble at all. } 2... Qxd5 { Black can play 2...Nf6 to avoid taking with the queen, but the continuation 3 d4 Nxd5 4 c4 Nf6 5 Nf3 Bg4 6 Be2 leaves White with both a fine pawn centre and the better prospects. } 3. Nc3 { The knight develops and gains a tempo by attacking the queen. One of the drawbacks of Black’s system of defence is that it subjects his queen to harassment by the minor pieces without her being able to bother them in return. The queen, for example, cannot threaten to capture a knight that is protected as that amounts to giving up the queen for a knight. The knight, though, can attack and threaten to capture the queen, whether the queen is protected or not. } 3... Qa5 { This move, exerting pressure on the diagonal leading to White’s king, is preferable to the shamefaced retreat by 3...Qd8. In either case, though, Black has had to make two moves with his queen, instead of developing another piece. The beginner likes to give check whenever he can, and here it might lead to something like this: 3...Qe5+ 4 Be2 Bg4 5 d4 Qe6 6 Be3 Bxe2 7 Ngxe2, and White has three pieces in play to Black’s one – and that one a badly placed queen. } 4. d4 { Once again seizing the centre. The pawn occupies d4, attacks the squares e5 and c5, and does further service in releasing the c1-bishop for action. } 4... e5 { Black once again lashes out at White’s centre! } 5. Nf3! { Far better than 5 dxe5, to which Black’s reply is 5...Bb4. White combines a threat (6 Nxe5) with the development of a piece. } 5... Bb4 { Black does not defend his pawn but intensifies the attack on White’s pinned knight. He does not care for 5...exd4 6 Qxd4, which only speeds White’s development. } 6. Bd2 { Chess can be so simple! White brings a third piece into play and at the same time eases the strain on his knight. Meanwhile he threatens 7 Nxe5, against which Black has no defence in 6...Nc6 as 7 a3 Bxc3 8 Bxc3 attacks the queen and wins the enemy pawn on e5. How does Black meet the threat? } 6... Bg4 { Answer: by another pin! Apparently, Black is not interested in routine defence, or for that matter in normal development. He wants his pieces to rush out of their corners fighting. If this strategy is sound, what is to become of all the principles of development – the precepts which in the hand of a master are his greatest weapons? So far, Black has violated the conventions governing proper development, by these acts: 1) he has brought the queen into play too early; 2) he has moved the same piece twice in the opening; 3) he has developed bishops before knights; 4) he has launched an attack before completing his development. The question is: can he get away with all this? } 7. Be2 { White keeps on developing. He brings another piece out and unpins his f3-knight. The threat of 8 Nxe5 becomes more acute. } 7... exd4 { Black is practically forced to make this capture, even though it leads to a position in White’s favour. But what else can he do? If he protects the e-pawn by 7...Nc6, then 8 a3 is again embarrassing, for example, after 8...Bd6 9 b4 Qb6 10 Na4 his queen is lost, while 8...Bxc3 9 Bxc3 Qd5 10 dxe5 simply loses a pawn. } 8. Nxd4 { The recapture discovers an attack on Black’s g4-bishop. } 8... Qe5 { Black’s response pins the e2-bishop and attacks the unprotected d4-knight. Black rejects 8...Bxe2 as the recapture by 9 Qxe2+ gains another tempo for White. } 9. Ncb5! { Suddenly White turns aggressor! He protects his exposed knight, attacks Black’s b4-bishop and threatens by 10 Nxc7+ Qxc7 11 Bxg4 to win a pawn. All this is directed toward bringing about further exchanges which will speed up his development and gain more and more tempi for him. } 9... Bxe2 { Black is forced into a series of exchanges which remove all the pieces he has developed from the board! } 10. Qxe2 { The recapture pins Black’s queen and forces the exchange of queens. } 10... Bxd2+ { The bishops too must come off, otherwise White wins a pawn after 10...Qxe2+ 11 Kxe2 Bd6 (to protect the c-pawn) 12 Nxd6+ cxd6 13 Nf5 . } 11. Kxd2 { The recapture benefits White in that it brings his king toward the centre for the endgame and clears away the last obstruction to the development of the rooks. They can now get to the important open files in the centre. As for the king, he is in no danger once the queens are off the board – and there is no way for Black to prevent them coming off! } 11... Qxe2+ { Delaying the exchange is dangerous as White threatens to win a rook by 12 Nxc7+. } 12. Kxe2 { Naturally, White takes with the king, as he does not want to displace the centralized knight. Tarrasch himself considered the game to be won at this point: he is five tempi ahead – one move by the king and two by each of the knights. } 12... Na6 { An awkward move, but it guards the c-pawn and facilitates queenside castling. On 12...Kd8 instead, Black’s a8-rook will have trouble coming out. } 13. Rhe1! { Very effective in that it prevents Black from developing his kingside. If he tries 13...Ne7, then 14 Kf3 uncovers a pin on the knight and ties the king down to its protection, while 13...Nf6 is refuted by 14 Kf3+ Kf8, and Black’s h8-rook is shut in indefinitely. } 13... O-O-O { The king flees (meanwhile mobilizing a rook) rather than stay in the centre and be harassed by White’s rooks. Has Black wriggled out of the coils? } 14. Nxa7+! { A startling combination, but combinations always appear for the player who has established a superior position. They do not emerge by chance but are the logical outcome of orderly, methodical play. At first glance, White’s capture looks unsound, as both his knights will soon be en prise, and one of them apparently is doomed. } 14... Kb8 { The king attacks one knight, the rook the other. How do the knights escape? If 15 Nab5, then 15...c6 wins a piece, while 15 Ndb5 c6 is similar. Two knights dependent on each other for protection are helpless against a pawn attack on either of them. } 15. Nac6+! { The point! White will get a rook and two pawns for his knights. This exchange favours White in material terms and he gains other advantages, as we shall see. } 15... bxc6 { Black has no choice, as 15...Kc8 instead loses rook and pawn for the knight. } 16. Nxc6+ { White continues with the combination. } 16... Kc8 { Necessary in order to capture the knight. } 17. Nxd8 { Removing Black’s most dangerous piece. After his knight is taken, White will be left with two pieces against three, but these two are dynamic rooks with a whole chessboard to roam around in, while of Black’s pieces, two are stuck away in a corner and one stands awkwardly on the sidelines. } 17... Kxd8 { Black still has the job of mobilizing his kingside pieces while staving off threats on the queenside. On that wing, White has three pawns to one, and this, after an exchange of pawns, can become two pawns to none. Black may have to face an advance of two connected passed pawns on the queenside. } 18. Rad1+ { More gain of time! The rook grabs the open file with check, and Black must lose a move getting his king out of the line of fire. } 18... Ke8 { After 18...Kc8 19 Kf3 (threatening 20 Re8+ Kb7 21 Rdd8 winning a piece) 19...Nf6 20 Re7 Rf8 White can either attack on the kingside by 21 g4 or start his pawn phalanx on the queenside rolling by 21 a3 followed by 22 b4. } 19. Kd3+ { The king moves toward Black’s disorganized queenside, where defence will be difficult. } 19... Ne7 { Reluctantly, it would seem, Black finally develops his king’s knight, but then again anything else loses! If 19...Kf8, then 20 Kc4 (threatening instant mate) 20...g6 21 Rd8+ Kg7 22 Kb5 and White wins the a6-knight, or if 19...Kd8, then 20 Kc4+ Kc8 21 Re8+ Kb7 22 Rdd8, and the g8-knight falls. } 20. Kc4 { The king gets out of the path of the rook and prepares to assist his queenside pawns. } 20... h5 { A peculiar way to develop the rook, but how else can it come out of the corner? Black is ready to repel the invasion 21 Kb5 by 21...Rh6 followed by 22...Rb6+. } 21. Rd3 { So White abandons this tack and indicates that he intends to double rooks on the e-file and win the pinned knight. } 21... Nb8 { The knight retreats in order to reach c6 and the aid of his companion. } 22. Rde3 { Doubles the pressure and threatens to capture the knight. } 22... Nc6 { The only possible way to save the pinned knight. } 23. b4 { Preparing to stab at the defending knight, drive it off, and win the other one. } 23... f6 { Providing a new spot for the c6knight. In reply to 24 b5 he can now play 24...Ne5+, intercepting the attack of the rooks. If later on the knight is evicted from e5, it can retreat to g6, where it again protects the e7-knight. } 24. f4! { This stops the knight reaching e5 and renews the threat of 25 b5. The position seems lost for Black, but Mieses not only ingeniously slips out of the pin and its terrors but also manages to set a subtle trap into which anyone might plunge! } 24... Kf7! { If White now tries to win a piece, this is what he might fall into: 25 b5 Na5+ 26 Kb4 Nd5+ 27 Kxa5 Ra8#! } 25. a4 { White avoids the pitfall and proceeds with the simple strategy governing all endgames: he pushes the passed pawn! } 25... Rb8 { Temporarily halting the march of the two pawns. White cannot play 26 a5 as 26...Rxb4+ wins a couple of pawns, while after 26 b5 Na5+ 27 Kc5 (not 27 Kb4 Nd5+, and White’s in the mating trap) 27...Nb7+ 28 Kc4 (moving to b4 or d4 allows a check by the other knight winning the exchange) 28...Na5+ the king is making no progress – he must either retreat or submit to a perpetual check. } 26. c3 { Simple and strong! White guards the b-pawn and prepares to advance the a-pawn. } 26... Rd8 { There is no way to stop 27 a5 so Black tries to get counterplay on the open file. } 27. Rd3! { Brutal but necessary. White must oppose rooks on the file. Black will either have to exchange rooks or move his rook away, leaving White in full possession of the file. One of the points a beginner learns painfully is that he must fight for control of every bit of territory, whether it is a file, a diagonal or a square. It is often necessary to offer an exchange of pieces to secure possession of an important point or area. Such offers must not be avoided for fear of their leading to a dull game, or that such strategy is unsportsmanlike. The player with a material advantage who temporizes because he wants to win brilliantly, and avoids exchanges because they are dull and unsportsmanlike, is only torturing his opponent. A win must be completed in the quickest, most efficient way possible. } 27... Rxd3 { Relinquishing the file offers the black rook no future on any other file – so he exchanges. } 28. Kxd3 { White is left with one piece to two, but his lone rook with its enormous mobility is more than a match for Black’s knights, who must keep in constant touch with each other to assure their mutual safety. } 28... Ke8 { The king rushes to the queenside to head off the passed pawn. } 29. a5 { Every move of this pawn increases Black’s danger. Keeping it under restraint will tie up his pieces so that he will have no time to think of counterattack. } 29... Kd7 { Black moves closer to the a-pawn, meanwhile unpinning his knight. } 30. a6 { Putting a stop to the king’s little trip, as 30 ...Kc8 is punished by 31 b5, when Black must give up one of his knights. Note again that having the two knights lean on each other for support is not an ideal arrangement. } 1-0

1. d4 { Although queen’s pawn openings are played with the idea of obtaining an early positional advantage, Marshall considered the best way to start an attack was to begin the game with 1 d4. One reason for his view might have been that the e-pawn openings no longer could be depended on to lead to wide-open games with opportunities for combinative play. In the old days when White began with 1 e4, the reply almost automatically was 1...e5. White could then offer a pawn by 2 f4, rely on its being accepted, and joyfully swing into the excitement of a King’s Gambit. In taking the pawn and grimly holding on to it, Black gained material, but the loss of time involved threw him on the defensive. Gradually, after sustaining many defeats, the players of Black tired of being the victims of brilliancies. They took a more rational attitude, and grew cautious. They resorted to 1...e6, 1...c5 or 1...c6, steering the game into channels of their own choosing. The result was that an aggressive player, starting the game with 1 e4, found himself facing ‘irregular’ defences, which forced the game into unfamiliar channels. He found himself involved in tightly knit positions requiring systematic planning, when he was itching to get an attack rolling. He was supposed to have the initiative, but here it was wrested away from him! How could he play a gambit (even at best a risky matter) if his opponent did not oblige him with a forthright 1...e5 in answer to his own enterprising 1 e4? In beginning the game with 1 d4, White gets an advantage, slight though it may be, against any system of defence – and with it he retains excellent attacking chances as well! } 1... d5 { Undoubtedly one of the strongest replies. Black stabilizes the pressure in the centre, prevents White from strengthening his hold there by 2 e4, and himself opens lines for two of his pieces to get into the game. } 2. c4 { An offer of a pawn (with strings attached) to induce Black to surrender the centre. } 2... e6 { Taking the pawn is perfectly sound, but why give up the centre to win a pawn which it turns out you cannot keep? Playing 2...dxc4 is equivalent to exchanging a centre pawn for a side pawn, in itself an unprofitable transaction. However, many leading players are happy to play this opening, so there must be some counterbalancing plus points. The main advantage is that Black no longer has the responsibility of supporting the d5-pawn, and this makes it easier for him to organize the crucial thrust ...c5, exchanging his own c-pawn for White’s d-pawn. Thus, although White has a temporary superiority in the centre, it is often not long before Black can restore a symmetrical central situation. After Black’s actual move, his d-pawn is firmly supported. If now 3 cxd5, Black recaptures with a pawn , maintaining a pawn in the centre. It is true that Black’s c8-bishop is shut in by the e-pawn, making its development difficult, and this is a drawback to the defence. But if Black’s first two moves are good, and they probably form the best reply to the Queen’s Gambit, then one can appreciate the terrific strength of this opening, and why so many players adopt 1 d4 unhesitatingly whenever they have White. } 3. Nc3 { This is somewhat sharper than developing the other knight first, as additional pressure is immediately put on the central point d5. } 3... Nf6 { Tarrasch did not approve of this knight move, which most of us would make instinctively. It is true that f6 is the most useful square for the king’s knight 99.44% of the time, since from there it influences affairs in the centre strongly, enjoys great freedom of movement, and is magnificently placed for attack and defence. However, Tarrasch feared the strength of the pin that White can clamp on the knight next move. Instead of 3...Nf6, he therefore recommended that Black challenge White’s centre at once by 3...c5 (the advance ...c5 is almost a must at some stage in queen’s pawn games), meanwhile opening up the c-file for the use of his own heavy pieces. Why then, you may ask, did Tarrasch play a move that he himself disparaged? His explanation is that this was the first game of a match against one of the world’s leading masters (Marshall had recently won the Cambridge Springs tournament without losing a game, ahead of Lasker, Schlechter, Pillsbury and Janowsky) and he did not wish to stray so soon from orthodox paths. } 4. Bg5! { Naturally! Not only because the bishop exerts uncomfortable pressure on the knight, but also because it is good policy to play moves that the opponent finds disturbing. If Tarrasch thinks that pinning the knight is troublesome - pin the knight and make him uneasy! } 4... Nbd7 { This looks clumsy, with the knight blocking what little view the c8-bishop had, but pieces can easily step out of each other’s way. The knight belongs on d7 and not on c6, where it obstructs the c-pawn. This pawn must not be hindered from advancing sooner or later to c5. Little as the pawn is, it represents a major force in disputing possession of the centre! With 4...Nbd7 Black sets a little trap for the unwary, invented by Tarrasch. If White, relying on the impotent state of Black’s pinned knight, tries to pick up a pawn by 5 cxd5 exd5 6 Nxd5, Black gives up his queen with 6...Nxd5 (breaking the pin by force) 7 Bxd8, only to regain it with another piece thrown in by 7...Bb4+ 8 Qd2 Bxd2+ 9 Kxd2 Kxd8. The moral is: don’t go pawnhunting in the opening! } 5. e3 { This sort of pawn move is not a waste of time. Without a liberating pawn move the bishops can never get off the ground, so this is part of the process of bringing the pieces into play. With the text-move, White opens two diagonals at once, one for his f1-bishop and another one for the queen. The e-pawn contributes an additional service in bracing up the pawn-centre. } 5... c6 { Black too reinforces his pawn-centre and gives his queen an outlet on the queenside. } 6. Qc2 { It is customary to develop the minor pieces first, roughly in this order: First the knights, generally to c3 and f3, but toward the centre in any event; then the bishops (after the necessary pawn moves), either to control vital diagonals or to pin enemy knights; following this, it is time for the queen to make her entrance. If the queen comes into the game too early, she incurs the danger of being harassed – perhaps even surrounded and captured – by enemy minor pieces. Last come the rooks, which after castling are brought to e1, d1 or c1, to head files in the centre which are partly open. These files are likely to become completely open after pawn exchanges in the centre. This method of development is not by any means to be considered a fixed course to pursue. Nothing in chess – no convention, principle or recommended procedure – is to be practised rigidly. The value of any single move or combination of moves can only be measured with respect to the particular position on the board. It must fit in with the scheme of the game you are playing and be tempered by the demands of the opponent. A great deal depends on what he does, or lets you do. This is why you may find it expedient to develop the queen at the sixth move or to castle at the sixtieth move. In this position Black has indicated that he might counterattack by 6... Qa5 and 7... Bb4, pinning the c3-knight and then increasing the pressure on it. It might have been more to the point for White instead to mobilize another minor piece by 6 Nf3 (like putting money in the bank), with an eye to speedy castling or perhaps to neutralizing the anticipated pressure on the c3-knight by swinging the f3-knight over to d2. } 6... Qa5 { A many-sided move: the queen not only unpins the f6-knight but starts a counteraction by pinning the white knight; Black threatens to intensify the pressure by bringing the f8-bishop to b4. As an extra, added attraction, Black sets a little trap to catch the careless – and this might even include expert players who at times treat the opening in a perfunctory way. The trap might snap shut on a player who innocently develops his bishop at d3 only to find that 7...dxc4 threatens both his bishops at one blow. White cannot escape from the trap by 8 Bxf6 as 8...cxd3 attacks his queen and wins a bishop. It might be as well to state at this point that Tarrasch did not expect to catch Marshall with such a primitive trap. Master players do not set traps if it involves injuring their own position. A trap which arises in the natural course of development is one thing, but to play for them deliberately at the risk of wasting valuable time is unforgivable. } 7. cxd5 { White neutralizes the queen’s indirect attack on his bishop and clears away the c-file for the benefit of his major pieces. } 7... Nxd5 { Tarrasch had planned to recapture by 7...exd5 in order to maintain a pawn in the centre. Now he realizes that danger may be involved in delaying the development of the queenside pieces any longer. His c8-bishop is locked in on one side by the d7-knight, and this knight must stay where it is, as it supports the other knight on f6. If he tries to develop the bishop on the queenside, then after ...b6 he cuts off the queen’s retreat. But the strategy of a master player must be flexible: it must be consistent with the requirements of the particular position at hand. Tarrasch would very much like to have a strong pawn-centre but dares not neglect the exigencies of development. So he heeds Nimzowitsch, who once said, “Giving up the centre must not here be regarded as illogical; was happiness no happiness because it endured for but a short time? One cannot always be happy.” Meanwhile the knight does add to the pressure on White’s pinned knight and renews the threat of winning the exposed bishop by 8...Nxc3 9 bxc3 Qxg5. } 8. Nf3 { “In his anxiety,” says Tarrasch, “to guard the threatened bishop, White makes a decisive mistake.” This is an interesting example of the value of accurate timing in chess. The fact that a normal developing move has intrinsic strength is secondary to the question of its usefulness in the one position in front of you, not in vaguely similar positions. Despite the fact that the knight occupies a most useful post at f3, and at the same time protects the bishop, its development is either too soon or too late. White is doing nothing about the problem of his pinned knight. This is where pressure is exerted; this is where danger is threatened. More to the point is 8 e4 instead, evicting Black’s knight and forcing it to declare its intentions. If then 8...Nxc3 9 Bd2 Qa4 10 Qxc3, White has resolved an uncomfortable situation. } 8... Bb4 { Tripling the attack on the knight. Black threatens to win at once by 9...Nxc3 10 bxc3 Bxc3+ followed by 11...Bxa1. How shall White meet the threat? If he plays the natural 9 Rc1, the knight is adequately guarded since it is attacked three times and defended three times. However, Black then capitalizes on a curious fact about the power of a pinned piece: not only is it helpless to make a move but it has also lost its ability to defend! Translated into chess language, this means that 9 Rc1 can be met by 9...Qxa2, a capture startling at first glance but an obvious one if we realize that the knight’s defensive power is illusory! I stress this circumstance because it is important. Knowing it, recognizing it and applying it has caused (chess) kingdoms to topple. All this fuss about winning a miserable a-pawn? Let’s see what would happen thereafter: After 9 Rc1 Qxa2, Black’s method is classical in its simplicity. He follows up by...Bxc3+ and after the recapture by the pawn exchanges queens. He has an extra pawn, but this is not enough advantage to bring about checkmate. He must increase his material superiority sufficiently to justify him in going after the king, and this can only be done by turning one of his pawns into a queen. So he selects the most likely candidate, in this case the passed a-pawn, and pushes it step by step up the board. The pawn’s advance faces the opponent with a problem that becomes more acute with every step taken by the pawn. He must head off the pawn or blockade it completely, in either case tying up one or more of his pieces to do so. The defence is under the strain of keeping the pawn under constant surveillance, while at the same time having to guard against a sudden switching of the attack toward his king. What often happens is that he either has to give up a piece for the pawn or allow further exchanges of pieces, a procedure which leads to inevitable loss. Such long-range plans are not based on exact calculation; they represent a general idea of the method for winning in positions of this nature. } 9. Kd2 { Not an appetizing move, as the king loses the privilege of castling, but it’s the only way to guard against losing some material. } 9... c5! { “Hits the nail on the head,” says Tarrasch. With the subsequent exchange of pawns, the c-file will be prised open, further endangering the unfortunate knight. } 10. a3 { White is anxious to bring matters to a head. The alternative 10 e4 yields to 10...cxd4 11 exd5 (or 11 Nxd4 Nxc3 12 bxc3 Qxg5+ and Black wins a piece - the exposed bishop that seemed doomed from the start) 11...dxc3+ 12 bxc3 Qxd5+ and Black is a pawn up with a winning position. } 10... Bxc3+ { Tarrasch simplifies and avoids the difficulties attendant on winning the exchange, such as: 10...cxd4 11 axb4 dxc3+12 Qxc3 Qxa1...Qxg7 Rf8 14...Nxb4...Bb5 Qxh1...Qf6 and White forces mate. It is true that Black could win the game at his fifteenth move by playing 15...Qa5, but why risk all these complications when the advantage can be maintained by less hazardous means? } 11. bxc3 { The only way White may recapture. } 11... cxd4 { Continuing the good work of opening up the c-file. } 12. exd4 { Again, White has no choice of recapture: the c-pawn is pinned, and 12 Nxd4 is refuted by 12...Nxc3 13 Qxc3 Qxg5, when Black has won a pawn. } 12... N7b6 { White’s pinned knight is gone, but it has been replaced by a pawn – and this pawn is also pinned! It makes a fine target, so Black directs his fire on it. He threatens to strike at it again by 13...Na4 or by 13...Bd7 followed by 14...Rc8. } 13. Bd3 { Finally, another kingside piece sees daylight! } 13... Bd7 { Black can pounce on the pawn with 13...Na4, but he prefers to complete his development first and then bring all his pieces to bear on it. “Besides,” as he says, anticipating Nimzowitsch, “the pawn does not run away.” } 14. Rhc1 { White must develop and defend at the same time. If he gets a moment’s respite, he will free the pinned pawn by...Ke2, 16 Bd2 and 17 c4. } 14... Rc8 { But Black doesn’t let up even for a moment! The rook seizes control of the beautiful open file and immediately adds its weight to the pressure on the immobilized c-pawn. } 15. Qb3 { Trying to lure Black into 15...Na4 16 Qxb7 Rxc3 17 Rxc3 Qxc3+ 18 Ke2, when he has counterplay. } 15... O-O { “First,” thinks Tarrasch, “let’s get the king away from the fighting and bring the other rook closer.” } 16. Ke2 { Clearly the c-pawn must be lost, as Black can attack it with more pieces than White can summon up for defence, so White saves time by abandoning the pawn and fleeing with his king. } 16... Rxc3 { The first material gain, and with it entry to the enemy position. } 17. Rxc3 { Avoiding the exchange of rooks by 17 Qb2 lets Black retain his grip on the open file. } 17... Qxc3 { Much better than taking with the knight. Black’s idea is to occupy a strategically strong outpost on the only open file or force an exchange of queens. The removal of the queens would simplify matters to his advantage, as he is a pawn ahead. } 18. Qb1 { Forced into retreat, White manages to incorporate the threat of...Bxh7+, regaining his pawn. } 18... h6 { The simplest way of saving the pawn, this also provides the king with a useful escape square against a surprise check on the last rank. } 19. Bd2 { Driven back, this piece too retires with a threat. } 19... Qc7 { The queen reluctantly leaves the beautiful outpost at c3 but stays on the all-important c-file. Note the reason the queen selects the c7-square: at c6 the action of the bishop is interfered with, at c8 that of the rook. Black threatens 20 ... Nf4+, forcing an exchange of the knight for one of White’s bishops. } 20. Kf1 { Everybody going home? } 20... Nc4 { Begins a new phase in which Black drives pieces into the enemy’s territory. These will control key squares and cramp White’s movements by limiting the mobility of his pieces. } 21. Bc1 { Just about the only place left, if White wants to keep both his bishops. } 21... Ba4 { And this cuts down the activities of White’s queen. } 22. Qa2 { Double attack on the knight! This is less a threat than a convenient means of gaining time to switch the queen over to the kingside. White’s only chance, of course, is to dream up some sort of counterattack. Passive play will only lead to his being gradually crushed to death. } 22... Rc8 { Black protects the knight and simultaneously takes undisputed possession of the c-file. } 23. Qe2 { White intends to stir up trouble by playing...Qe4 (threatening...Qh7+ Kf8 26 Qh8+ Ke7...Qxg7). Then if 24...Nf6, the reply 25 Qh4, threatening 26 Bxh6, might whip up some sort of attack on the kingside, } 23... Nc3! { Not only does this move put a stop to any notions White might have had of starting a counteroffensive, but it also restricts his queen, which is attacked, to one solitary move! Such is the extent of Black’s domination of the board! } 24. Qe1 { The only refuge left from the terrible knights who cover seven of the queen’s flight squares! } 24... Na5 { With the obvious plan of penetrating deeper into White’s position by 25...Nb3. This would result, as a start, in winning the exchange. } 25. Bxh6 { Lashing out with the wildness born of despair! The game could not have been saved by 25 Bd2 as after 25...Nb3 (the knights now circumscribe the rook’s activities as they did the queen’s) 26 Bxc3 Qxc3 27 Rd1 (or 27 Qxc3 Rxc3 28 Rd1 Nc1, when Black wins the exchange or a piece) 27...Nc1, when the attack on White’s rook and bishop will win some material. } 25... Nb3 { Taking the bishop might lead to a win, but why expose the king needlessly? Black’s actual move is simpler and more in keeping with his queenside manoeuvres up to this point. } 26. Bd2 { White could not rescue the helpless rook, so must content himself with the fact that he has regained the pawn he lost. } 26... Nxa1 { Winning the exchange is the culmination of some clever horseplay by the knights. } 27. Qxa1 { White must capture this way, and not 27 Bxc3, which loses a whole rook after 27...Qxc3 . } 27... Bb5! { The fine art of simplification! Black exchanges pieces to cut down resistance. With fewer pieces on the board, fewer complications can be introduced by White, while Black’s material advantage becomes proportionally greater. Notice how Black engineers these exchanges without weakening his grip on the position. } 28. Bxb5 { As good as there is: after 28 Bxc3 Bxd3+ followed by 29...Qxc3 Black wins a piece, while 28 Qxc3 Qxc3 29 Bxc3 Bxd3+ and 30...Rxc3 does likewise. } 28... Nxb5 { Now Black threatens 29...Qc4+ 30 Ke1 Nc3, and the threat of mate at e2 forces 31 Bxc3, whereupon 31...Qxc3+ 32 Qxc3 Rxc3 leaves an elementary winning position. } 29. g3 { White hopes to find shelter for the king at g2, where it is less exposed, and also sets up a pawn support for the bishop, which might get a new start at f4. } 29... Qc6! { The queen pounces on the light squares that have been weakened by White’s last move. The attack on the knight gains a tempo for the queen’s further penetration into White’s territory. } 30. Kg2 { An advance by the knight, e.g. 30 Ne5, loses the queen after 30...Qh1+, while protecting the knight with 30 Ke2 runs into 30...Qe4+ 31 Be3 Rc2+ 32 Nd2 (or 32 Kd1 Nc3+ winning) 32...Ra2! when 33 Qxa2 Nc3+ costs White his queen, while otherwise the d4-pawn falls with check. } 30... Rd8 { Now onto this file, where the isolated pawn makes a fine target. } 31. Be3 { Guarding the d-pawn, since the pinned knight is no protection. } 31... Qe4 { The queen works her way deeper into the heart of the position. } 32. Qb2 { White tries to get some play for his queen, while the other pieces huddle around each other for mutual protection. The queen does not rush to seize the open file, as after 32 Qc1 Nxd4 33 Bxd4 Rxd4 the threat of 34...Rd3 is more than White can stand. } 32... Rd5! { A diabolical move! Not only does Black guard his own knight, but he also threatens to win White’s by 33...Rf5 34 Qe2 Nxd4!, an attack on the queen and a triple attack on the knight. There is no answer to this as White is pinned all over the place! } 33. a4 { Driving the knight off so that it no longer attacks the d-pawn. } 33... Nd6 { The knight leaves, taking care to protect the b-pawn. } 34. Bf4 { Otherwise, Black plays 34...g5, threatening 35...g4 or 35...Rf5, or both! } 34... Nf5 { Once more striking at the d-pawn. } 35. Be3 { White cannot afford...Qxb7 as after 35...Nxd4 36 Qc8+ Kh7 37 Qc3 g5 he loses more material. } 35... Nxe3+ { Simpler than combinations beginning with 35...e5. After the text-move, two more pieces come off the board, and another pawn will fall. } 36. fxe3 { White must recapture. } 36... Qxe3 { This unpins the knight, but the knight must stay where it is to protect the d-pawn. } 37. g4 { White must not play 37 Qxb7 as the reply 37...Qe2+ forces the king away from the knight and costs a piece. His actual move stops Black from increasing the pressure by 37...Rf5. } 37... f5 { Black can afford this opening up of the position. His king suffers less from exposure than does White’s. The threat of course is 38...fxg4, winning at once. } 38. g5 { After 38 h3 fxg4 39 hxg4 Qf4 40 g5 Qg4+ 41 Kf2 Rf5 the threats of 42...Qxf3+ and 42...Qxg5 cannot both be met. } 38... Qe4 { Once more clamping a pin on the knight! } 39. Qc3 { Carefully avoiding...Qxb7, when 39...f4 faces him with loss of the knight by 40...Qe2+ or loss of the g-pawn by 40...Rxg5+. } 39... f4 { Not at once 39...e5 because 40 g6 leaves White threatening sudden mate! } 40. Qc8+ { If White had tried 40 g6 then 40...Rg5+ would end the g-pawn’s career. } 40... Kh7 { To escape any more checks by the queen. } 41. Qc3 { Back to the defence of the knight and the d-pawn. } 41... e5! { This signals the beginning of the last phase: the break-up of White’s centre. This is stronger than 41...Rxg5+ 42 Kf2 Rh5 43 h4, when White threatens 44 Ng5+. The idea of the text-move is to continue with 42...Rxd4, with which Black accomplishes these things: } 42. h4 { Marshall sees that 42 dxe5 loses a piece after 42...Rd3 but he still has a few tricks up his sleeve. } 42... Rxd4 { Intending to attack queen and knight by 43...Rd3, incidentally cutting off the queen from the knight’s defence. } 43. g6+ { This is one of the traps: if Black plays 43...Kxg6, White replies 44 Qb3 (apparently trying to get a perpetual check) 44...Rd3, and now instead of 45 Qe6+ White plays 45 Qxd3 Qxd3 46 Nxe5+ followed by 47 Nxd3 regaining the queen and winning a rook. } 43... Kh6 { Black side-steps this one. } 44. Kh2 { So White sets up another trap: if 44...Rd3 45 Qxe5 Qxf3, then 46 Qg5#! } 44... Qe2+ { To this there is no reply: 45 Kg1 Rd1+ 46 Ne1 Rxe1+ wins, or 45 Kh3 Rd3, pinning the poor knight for the last time, puts out the last flickers of resistance. } 0-1

1. d4 { In this game, the art of chess is reduced to a simple formula: get a passed pawn, move it up the board, and win! White begins by getting a foothold in the centre, while releasing two of his pieces. } 1... d5 { This is probably Black’s strongest reply. It equalizes the pressure and prevents White from monopolizing the centre with 2 e4. } 2. Nf3 { The knight leaps in toward the centre, intensifying the pawn’s pressure on e5. The knight does its best work at f3, covering eight squares in the circle of its attack. } 2... Nf6 { Black applies the same formula, developing his g8-knight to its most effective post. Aside from its admirable potential for attack, the knight also serves while it stands and waits. In the service of the king, especially after castling, the knight defends as no other piece can. } 3. e3 { Not the most energetic procedure, but White need not be aggressive from the start. The opening itself is so strong that White can build up a promising position merely by developing his pieces so that they occupy the most suitable squares immediately. The method is simplicity itself: Put every single piece to work, and move no piece twice until development is complete. The fact that 3 e3 releases one bishop but shuts in another is of little moment, as the c1-bishop can get into the game by way of b2. White does not indicate his specific intentions: he might play the Colle Attack or perhaps simply develop the bishop at d3 with a view to early kingside castling. } 3... c6 { Black supports his d-pawn, anticipating an attack on it by 4 c4. He prefers this to the alternative pawn support by 3...e6, which confines his queen’s bishop. However, if Black wants to free his bishop, why not move it at once to f5? There it would stand ready to oppose White’s bishop when it moves to d3. The almost inevitable bishop exchange then removes White’s attacking bishop from the board and takes the sting out of the Colle system of attack. Another possibility was pushing on to c5 at once with his pawn, striking at White’s centre, and opening the c-file for the use of his own heavy pieces. But why play 3...c6, moving a pawn unnecessarily in the opening? Why waste time defending when nothing is threatened? } 4. Bd3 { Quiet, forceful development: the bishop surveys two fine diagonals and is ready for action in either direction. Meanwhile the kingside is cleared for castling. } 4... Bg4 { As good as there is for this bishop. The best square the bishop could occupy is f5, but White’s last move made this square unavailable. } 5. c4! { Alert play! White strikes at the enemy centre and prepares to open the c-file for the convenience of his major pieces. The diagonal created for his queen also holds out prospects of a raid by 6 Qb3 on Black’s queenside, weakened by the absence of his bishop. } 5... e6 { Black’s f8-bishop is provided with an outlet, while the central d-pawn is given further support. } 6. Nbd2 { White defends the f3-knight with a minor piece, relieving the queen of a duty. This method of developing the knight is preferable to placing it at c3, where it might interfere with the future operations of the queen or the rook on the c-file. The sortie 6 Qb3 yields no immediate advantage, since Black’s reply 6 ... Qb6 leads either to an exchange of queens or a retreat by White’s queen. } 6... Nbd7 { For Black’s knight, too, this is model development. A td7 it cooperates with the f6-knight and supports an eventual attack on White’s centre by ...c5 or ...e5. Either of these freeing moves is an objective Black must strive to attain in this opening. } 7. O-O { The king rushes off to safer quarters while the rook comes out of hiding. } 7... Be7 { This develops a piece and enables Black to castle but is rather unenterprising. A more spirited course was 7...e5 attempting to have something to say about affairs in the centre. } 8. Qc2! { So White puts a stop to any such ideas! An advance by 8...e5 now costs a pawn, as White’s knight, no longer pinned, is free to pick off the pawn. The queen’s development at c2 is modest, but in the early stages of the game, the queen should rarely venture beyond the third or fourth rank. What is important, though, is to move the queen off the back rank and into active play. } 8... Bh5 { Black prepares to swing the lightsquared bishop around to g6 to exchange it for White’s aggressive d3-bishop. Had he castled instead, then 9 Ne5 Bh5 (9...Nxe5 10 dxe5 Nd7 11 Bxh7+ wins a pawn for White) 10 f4 gives White a powerfully centralized knight and excellent attacking prospects. } 9. b3 { A pawn move that provides an outlet for a piece is always justified. This one makes room for the c 1-bishop’s development. } 9... Bg6 { Black continues with the business of forcing an exchange of lightsquared bishops. } 10. Bb2 { From a distance, the dark-squared bishop intensifies White’s pressure on the important central square e5. With this square under control, it will be difficult for Black to get in the freeing move ...e5. } 10... Bxd3 { There was no hurry about this exchange. Why not calmly keep on with the job of developing pieces, as White does? } 11. Qxd3 { After this recapture, White has all the play. He can choose from various plans: 1) a break-up by e4, to open lines of attack for his pieces; 2) the establishment of an outpost at e5 by the knight; 3) a hemming-in process, beginning with c5. } 11... O-O { There is no way for Black to meet all these continuations, so he transfers his king to a safe shelter. } 12. Rae1 { Before committing himself, White brings another piece into play. The rook’s presence on the e-file will add power to the e-pawn’s advance. White does not take action until his development is complete. } 12... Qc7 { Black mobilizes another piece, hoping for some counterplay by 13...c5. The development of the queen also enables the rooks to establish communication with each other. } 13. e4! { Opening up lines of attack, which, says theory, will favour the player whose development is superior. White rejects 13 c5, the reply to which would be 13...e5 14 dxe5 Nxc5. 13 Ne5 is no more promising, since 13...Nxe5 14 dxe5 Nd7 15 f4 f6 lets Black off too easily. } 13... dxe4 { Otherwise Black must live in constant dread of e5 or exd5, either of which White can play at his own convenience. } 14. Nxe4 { The recapture leaves White with a formidable centre. } 14... Nxe4 { Black exchanges pieces to help free his crowded position. } 15. Rxe4! { Anticipating the natural defensive response 15...Nf6, to which White would reply 16 Rh4. The plan is then to dislodge Black’s knight, which guards against mate. This might be accomplished by 17 d5 followed by 18 Bxf6 or by 17 Ne5 followed by 18 Ng4. To prevent capture or uprooting of his knight and the consequent Qxh7#, Black would have to play ...g6 or ...h6, in either case loosening the pawn structure and thereby weakening the king’s defences. } 15... Bf6 { This prevents...Rh4, gives the bishop more scope and puts pressure on White’s centre. It also incorporates a pretty threat in 16... Nc5 17 dxc5 Bxb2, simplifying to Black’s advantage. } 16. Qe3 { White puts an end to that little scheme! } 16... c5 { This certainly looks attractive! Black plans 17...cxd4, a capture that White cannot avoid, his d-pawn being pinned. With the disappearance of White’s troublesome central pawn, the squares e5 and c5 then become available to Black’s knight, and the c-file opens up for counterplay by his queen and rook. } 17. Ne5 { The knight establishes an outpost. It seems harmless enough: it threatens nothing and does not interfere with whatever ideas Black has in mind. } 17... cxd4 { Counting on the continuation 18 Bxd4 Bxe5 19 Bxe5 Nxe5 20 Rxe5 Rfd8, when Black’s control of the open d-file greatly increases his chances. } 18. Nxd7! { A remarkable concept! Not because White plays a combination which involves a queen sacrifice, but that the offer of the queen is only a detail! It is subordinate to the overall strategy of the game, which is being conducted on positional lines and will be won that way. Any combinations that arise will be incidental to the general plan, which is to create a passed pawn, move it up at every opportunity and promote it to a queen. } 18... Qxd7 { If he accepts the offer and plays 18...dxe3 White reveals this combination:...Nxf6+ Kh8 (or 19...gxf6 20 Rg4+ Kh8 21 Bxf6#) 20 Rh4 (threatening 21 Rxh7#) 20...h6 21 Rxh6+! gxh6 22 Nd5+ Kg8 23 Nxc7 and White, with two pieces for a rook, wins easily. } 19. Bxd4 { White regains the pawn, and his bishop now attacks in two directions. On the one hand, it threatens to take the a-pawn, on the other it aims at checkmate by...Bxf6 gxf6 21 Rg4+ Kh8 22 Qh6 Rg8 23 Qxf6+ and mate next move. } 19... Bxd4 { The bishop must be done away with! } 20. Rxd4 { White recaptures and gains a tempo by attacking the queen. } 20... Qc7 { The best square. From here the queen’s mobility is at its maximum. } 21. Rfd1 { Now we can appreciate the significance of White’s offer of the queen. It was not an attempt to win the game by surprise tactics; it was the employment of a combination as a device to gain ground positionally! White’s doubling of the rooks on the d-file gives him full control of that file, and his pawn majority of three to two on the queenside offers the possibility of creating a passed pawn on the c-file. } 21... Rfd8 { Black must oppose rooks before White either establishes a rook on the seventh rank or triples pieces on the file. } 22. b4! { This starts the queenside pawns rolling! Capablanca does not even cast a glance at such a transparent trap as 22 Rxd8+ Rxd8 23 Rxd8+ Qxd8 24 Qxa7 Qd1#. } 22... Rxd4 { The exchange is almost forced. Otherwise, the need to protect the rook ties down Black’s queen and his other rook. } 23. Qxd4 { Naturally, White takes with the queen to keep two major pieces on the open file. } 23... b6 { Black must play this or 23...a6 in order to make use of his rook. Note that he cannot dispute the open file by 23...Rd8, as White snaps off the rook and mates next move. } 24. g3 { A safety measure to give the king a flight square from surprise checks on the first rank; such checks very often turn out to be fatal. } 24... Rc8 { Doubling the attack on the c-pawn. } 25. Rc1 { In order to save the pawn, White must shift his rook from the d-file, but now the rook is behind the c-pawn (the candidate for promotion) and is in position to keep it under protection, no matter how far the pawn moves up the file. } 25... Rd8 { Black’s object is to drive the queen off and command the d-file himself with his rook. } 26. Qe3 { A shrewd move: the queen keeps in touch with the rook, prevents Black’s rook from coming in at d1, and keeps a weather eye on the strategically important c5-square, the c-pawn’s next stop. } 26... Kf8 { The king approaches the field of action. In the event of a general exchange of pieces, he is prepared to head off the c-pawn. } 27. c5 { White’s pawn advances at every available opportunity. } 27... bxc5 { Expecting White to recapture by 28 bxc5, whereupon he blockades the pawn effectively by 28...Qc6 . } 28. Qe4! { Very clever! White need not recapture immediately, as Black’s pawn is pinned and cannot escape capture. Meanwhile, the queen move stops the intended blockade by 28...Qc6 and prepares 29 bxc5 followed by 30 c6. } 28... Rd5 { The rook rushes to help the c-pawn. There is a temptation for White to go pawn-hunting now by 29 Qxh7 followed by 30 Qh8+ and 31 Qxg7, picking up a couple of pawns and creating for himself a passed h-pawn. But this sort of random play would not be consistent with White’s orderly, economical conduct of the game, and entirely out of character for a Capablanca! } 29. bxc5 { A passed pawn at last! } 29... g6 { It would not do to recapture by 29...Rxc5 as White punishes the offending rook by 30 Qb4 pinning and then winning it. } 30. c6 { Passed pawns must be pushed! With each step forward, the scope of White’s rook increases, while the freedom of Black’s pieces becomes more limited. } 30... Kg7 { Black realizes that bringing the king to the centre might be suicidal, viz.: 30...Ke7 31 Qh4+ Kd6 32 Qb4+ Ke5 33 Qf4#! } 31. a4! { A beautiful preparatory move! If White were to play 31 Qb4 at once, aiming for 32 Qb7 (in order to dislodge the blockader) Black could exchange queens and then stop the pawn by 33...Rb5, coming behind it. However, with White’s a-pawn at a4, Black could not bring his rook to b5! } 31... Rd6 { Putting the pawn under lock and key. It cannot advance, and White’s intended stratagem of manoeuvring his queen over to b7 is not feasible, Black’s reply to 32 Qb4 being simply 32...Rxc6. But the very fact that one pawn can keep Black’s queen and rook occupied is a tribute to the power of a passed pawn. } 32. Qe5+! { In spite of the heavy guard surrounding the pawn, White with one stroke will lift the blockade! } 32... f6 { No matter how Black gets out of check, he cannot stop the coming combination. } 33. Qxd6! { Destroying one of the guards! } 33... Qxd6 { And the recapture lures the other one away! The pawn becomes a queen next move, leaving White a whole rook ahead. } 34. c7 { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0

1. d4 { One way of getting a good share of the centre is to take it! White does so here by planting one of his pawns right in the middle of the board. It occupies d4, one square, and secures a grip on two others, e5 and c5. } 1... Nf6 { More elastic than 1...d5. Black develops a piece and bears down on the centre instead of occupying it with a pawn. His knight attacks d5 and e4, and prevents White gaining more ground with 2 e4. } 2. c4 { This advance is a valuable freeing move in queen’s pawn openings. It attacks the central square d5, makes the c-file a favourable one for the rook (because of the likelihood of the file being later opened up) and offers the queen access to the queenside. } 2... e6 { Not at once 2...d5 as 3 cxd5 Qxd5 (or 3...Nxd5 4 e4 Nf6 5 Nc3, when White has more of the centre than he is entitled to) 4 Nc3 gains time for White by the attack on the queen. With 2...e6, Black prepares a pawn support for a later occupation of the centre by ...d5. Meanwhile, he releases his f8-bishop. } 3. Nc3 { This is sharper than developing the g1-knight. It backs up a threat of 4 e4, presenting a formidable array of pawns in the centre. } 3... Bb4 { The bishop clamps down on the knight and, by its pin, deprives it of the power to attack or defend. Thus, if White carelessly played 4 e4, Black could snap up the pawn at once. } 4. Qc2 { With a number of objects in view: 1) the square c2 is generally the queen’s most useful post in this opening; 2) the queen guards the knight: in the event of Black playing 4...Bxc3 +, the queen may recapture and leave White’s pawn structure undisturbed; 3) the queen exerts pressure on the c-file, the advantage of which becomes manifest with the opening of the file; 4) the queen, by controlling e4, renews White’s threat of advancing the e-pawn two squares. } 4... d5 { Wresting control of e4 from White and restraining his ambitious e-pawn from taking too long a first step. } 5. Nf3 { Quiet, perhaps too quiet. It gets the king’s knight off the ground, but the lull gives Black an opportunity to seize the initiative. } 5... c5! { “Black equalizes in any queen’s pawn opening,” says Reuben Fine, “where he can play both ...d5 and ...c5 with impunity.” With 5...c5 Black aims to destroy White’s pawn-centre, or at the very least to maintain a state of tension in that important area. As a fringe benefit, his queenside pieces have a bit more elbow-room. } 6. cxd5 { White’s idea is to clarify the position in the centre. The disappearance of his c4-pawn also helps to increase the pressure of the queen on the c-file. } 6... Qxd5 { Preferable to 6...exd5 which allows 7 Bg5, an annoying pin of the knight. The queen is strongly centralized at d5, and in no danger of being annoyed by White’s minor pieces. } 7. a3 { White has had enough of this tiresome bishop! } 7... Bxc3+ { Black must exchange. If instead 7...Ba5, then 8 b4 (threatening 9 Nxd5) 8...cxb4 9 Nxd5 b3+ 10 Bd2 bxc2 11 Nxf6+ gxf6 12 Bxa5 and White has won a piece. } 8. bxc3 { Capturing with the queen instead lets Black gain a tempo by 8...Ne4 attacking the queen, whereupon the prospect of White’s playing e4 seems further away than ever. In compensation for White’s theoretical advantage of the two bishops against knight and bishop, Black’s pawn position on the queenside is distinctly superior. } 8... Nc6 { The knight develops with a threat. There is now a triple attack on White’s d-pawn, and this limits his choice of reply. } 9. e3 { The least of the evils, though it does shut in the c1-bishop. The alternative 9 dxc5 Qxc5 saddles White with two weak, isolated pawns, while after 9 c4 Nxd4 10 Qa4+ (or 10 cxd5 Nxc2+ and Black wins a rook) 10...Qd7 Black is a pawn up. } 9... O-O { The king finds a safer shelter, while the h8-rook makes its appearance. } 10. Be2 { The bishop develops gingerly. A more energetic procedure was 10 c4 to dislodge the queen from the centre, followed by 11 Bb2, with fair chances. } 10... cxd4 { This clever pawn exchange keeps the position fluid and gives Black a slight advantage after any recapture. } 11. cxd4 { Understandably, White rejects 11 Nxd4 as 11...Qxg2 12 Bf3 Nxd4 in reply is ruinous. With his actual move, White adheres to the principle of capturing toward the centre and increases the queen’s sphere of action by opening the c-file. Nevertheless, it might have been better policy to play 11 exd4, activating his dark-squared bishop. } 11... b6 { Preparing to develop the bishop at b7, where it will command one of the longest diagonals on the board. Black’s advantage consists mainly in his two pawns to one on the queenside, and this, after an exchange of pawns, can turn into one pawn against none. As for the c-file, it can be seized by the a8-rook. The rook will drive White’s queen off and remain in control of the file. } 12. Nd2 { White wants the long diagonal for himself, so he vacates f3 for the bishop. He hardly hopes to lure Capablanca into a cheap trap by 12...Qxg2, when 13 Bf3 wins apiece. This sort of thing does not happen in real life. } 12... Bb7 { The bishop stands beautifully here, despite the fact that two pieces obstruct its path. Meanwhile, the c8-square is ready for occupancy by another tenant, the a8-rook. } 13. Bf3 { The bishop is well posted here, but at what a cost in time!The knight has had to retreat, and the development of White’s queenside pieces has been neglected. } 13... Qd7 { The queen keeps in touch with the knight, which is under attack by two pieces. } 14. O-O { Trying to get in the advance of the e-pawn is premature as 14 e4 Nxd4 costs a pawn, while 14 Bxc6 Bxc6 15 e4 Qxd4 16 Qxc6 Qxa1 loses the exchange. } 14... Rac8 { Black threatens 15...Nxd4, and thereby suggests that White’s queen leave the c-file. } 15. Qb1 { The aggressive 15 Qa4 is risky as 15..Ne5 16 Qxd7 (16 Qxa7 Nxf3+ 17 Nxf3 Qc6 followed by 18...Ra8 puts the queen in trouble) 16...Nxf3+ 17 Nxf3 Nxd7 is strong for Black. } 15... Na5! { Offering an exchange of bishops. Refusing it leaves Black in full possession of the long diagonal. } 16. Bxb7 { It might have been safer to concede the diagonal by 16 Be2 and keep more pieces on the board. Exchanging simplifies the position and accentuates Black’s superiority. } 16... Qxb7 { Black is now ready to exploit the circumstance that his opponent’s light squares are vulnerable to invasion. These squares have been weakened by the disappearance of the light-squared bishop. This advantage, together with that of Black’s pawn majority on the queenside (a circumstance which generally results in the creation of a passed pawn) should be enough to forecast a win for him. From this point on, we will see a demonstration of the technique of winning a won game. } 17. Bb2 { Finally, White gets his queenside rolling. Laudable as this object is, it was essential to anticipate Black’s next move and play 17 Qd3. This would strengthen White’s weak squares and hold off for a time the threatened invasion. } 17... Qa6! { A very fine manoeuvre! The queen takes leave of the long diagonal to exert great pressure on a more important one. The queen threatens to come in strongly at e2 and make coordination by White’s pieces difficult. } 18. Re1 { Parrying the threat. On 18 Rc1 instead (to put up a fight for the c-file), Black plays 18...Qe2 19 Nf3 (or 19Ra2 Ng4 20 Rxc8 Qxf2+ and Black wins) 19...Nb3 20 Rxc8 Rxc8 21 Ra2 Rc1+!, and White must give up his queen or be mated. } 18... Nd5 { Admirable centralization – but it’s only temporary. The knight is on its way to the queenside, the theatre of action. } 19. Ra2 { Intending either to oppose rooks by 20 Ba1 followed by 21 Rc2 or to continue with 20 Qa1 preventing 20...Nc3. } 19... Rc6 { Clearly in order to double rooks on the c-file. Black is in no hurry to move his knight to c3; first he wants to induce White to dislodge the knight from the centre. } 20. e4 { A deceptive move. It looks strong, but the central pawns are exposed and can easily become targets of an attack. } 20... Nc3! { It may seem strange that Black gives up a healthy knight for a sickly bishop, but this precaution is necessary before the rooks venture into enemy territory. With less material on the board, the rooks will be less exposed to the stings of the minor pieces. } 21. Bxc3 { The knight had to be removed, as it was attacking queen and rook. } 21... Rxc3 { The recapture enables the rook to penetrate deeper into White’s position. } 22. Nf3 { White makes an effort to regroup his pieces. If he tries to dispute the c-file by 22 Rc1 then 22...Rxc1+ 23 Qxc1 Qd3 24 Qb2 Rd8 wins a central pawn. } 22... Rfc8 { The doubled rooks now dominate the open file. Theoretically, Black has a won game. His positional superiority is undeniable, and winning, in a favourite phrase of the masters, ‘is simply a matter of technique’. A pleasant state of affairs, but one which involves a psychological danger. There is a tendency to relax and let up on the attack. It is easy to be lulled into a false sense of security, a circumstance which prompted Marshall’s observation, “The hardest thing is to win a won game”. } 23. h3 { White gives his king an escape square – in lieu of anything better to do. Black’s rooks cannot be driven off (if 23 Re3, then 23...Rc1 + wins the queen) so White temporizes and awaits the turn of events. } 23... Nc4 { The first in a series of skilfully blended moves which speed up the tempo. To begin with, there is a triple attack on the a-pawn. } 24. a4 { No other move saves the pawn. } 24... Na3 { Very neat! The knight attacks the queen and simultaneously cuts off the a-pawn’s protection by the rook. } 25. Qb2 { Voluntarily giving up a pawn which he cannot keep. If he tries to hold on to the pawn by 25 Qd1, then 25...Qc4 26 Rb2 (the rook was attacked) 26...Nc2 (now the other one is threatened) 27 Re2 Qxa4 28 Ne1 (striking at the pinned black knight) 28...Qxd4 ! wins for Black. } 25... Qxa4 { The first tangible gain. Now watch the greatest genius the game of chess ever produced demonstrate the art of transforming a passed pawn into a queen. Notice how any combinations that do not relate to that objective, no matter how attractive, are carefully avoided. Such intensity of purpose is frightening (especially to one who has to face it!). } 26. Re2 { White is running out of good moves. He rejects 26 Qe2 as the reply 26...Rc2 leads to further exchanges. An attack on the pinned knight by 26 Rea1 is cleverly met by 26...Qb5, nimbly extricating the knight from danger. } 26... b5 { Passed pawns must be pushed! Everything else – combinations to win pieces, gathering up stray pawns, even attacks on the king – must be relegated to the background as incidental to the main theme of queening the advanced pawn. } 27. d5 { White opens lines for some sort of counterattack, trying to create a diversion. } 27... exd5 { The simplest response, as the recapture will give White an isolated pawn in the middle of the board. } 28. exd5 { In return for this, White’s e2-rook looks out on a completely open file. In fact, White threatens 29 Qxc3 Rxc3 30 Re8#. } 28... b4! { An obvious move, but brilliant nevertheless in the number of things it accomplishes: 1) it nullifies White’s threat, the e8-square now being covered by the queen; 2) it defends the knight, freeing the queen from that duty; 3) it advances the pawn one step nearer its ultimate goal, the eighth rank. } 29. Qd2 { Not only to support his own passed pawn but to bring the queen into active play. } 29... b3 { Complying with the Manhattan Chess Club epigram, “Black passed pawns travel faster than White”. } 30. Rb2 { This holds out longer than 30 Ral Rc2 31 Qe3 b2, when Black wins more quickly. } 30... Rc2 { Black’s play is crystal clear: the passed pawn must be pushed and its path is blocked by a rook. Therefore the blockader must be removed! } 31. Qe3 { White hopes to complicate matters, as 31 Rxc2 is not attractive. } 31... Rxb2 { The proper rook to capture, this begins a series of pretty moves that decides the game. } 32. Rxb2 { White must recapture. } 32... Nc4! { An attack on queen and rook which threatens to win the exchange. } 33. Qc1 { White rescues the rook by pinning the knight. It would not do to play 33 Qxb3 instead as Black simply takes the rook, and his knight now protects the queen. } 33... Qa3! { The pin of the knight is met by a counter-pin of the rook, which Black now threatens to take with his queen. } 34. Rb1 { But the rook wriggles out of the pin. Has Black let the win slip? } 34... Qxc1+! { Not at all! This compels capitulation since after 35 Rxc1 b2 (the pawn must move on) 36 Rb1 Rb8 37 Kf1 Na3 (driving off the last blockader) 38 Rd1 Qb1 the passed pawn wins the game for Black. } 0-1

1. d4 { A favourite of modern players, this is one of the best possible ways to begin the struggle for mastery of the centre – by occupying it with a pawn and permitting two pieces to come quickly into play. } 1... Nf6 { Unlike 1...d5 this does not meet the opponent head-on, but it does prevent him from continuing with 2 e4 and has the added merit of developing a piece at once to its proper square in the opening. } 2. c4 { There are many good points about this move: 1) It restrains Black from an immediate 2...d5, as the reply 3 cxd5 forces a recapture with a piece and destroys his short-lived pawn-centre. 2) It opens the c-file for the use of White’s major pieces. 3) It makes a diagonal available to the queen. 4) It enables the two pawns standing side by side to get a grip on four squares on the fifth rank. } 2... e6 { Black’s f8-bishop is to be developed aggressively, to influence affairs in the centre. If White replies 3 Nc3, for example, in order to follow up with 4 e4, Black pins the knight and makes 4 e4 impossible. } 3. Nf3 { White cannot enforce the advance of the e-pawn, so he makes a normal developing move and awaits events. } 3... b6 { Further restraint on the project! Black intends to place his bishop at b7, where it attacks from a distance. The bishop will add its strength to that of the knight in the control of the critical e4-square. } 4. g3 { White’s best course is to oppose bishops on the long diagonal as one does with rooks on an open file. In setting up an equal opposing force, he takes the sting out of the enemy bishop’s attack. } 4... Bb7 { Strictly a modern concept! In olden times they filled up the centre with pawns and then fianchettoed the bishop, with the result that the bishop was deprived of any usefulness. Nowadays the bishop is free to strike all along the diagonal, unhampered by fixed pawns cluttering up his path. } 5. Bg2 { With the completion of the fianchetto, White’s kingside is cleared, and he is ready to castle. } 5... Bb4+ { Before attempting to undermine the centre by ...c5, Black develops a piece. Not only does the bishop’s move expedite castling, but it also brings about a favourable exchange of bishops. } 6. Bd2 { This is preferable to 6 Nbd2, a passive interposition which gives Black time to castle and then attack the centre by 7...d5. } 6... Bxd2+ { Black proceeds with the exchange as the best means of freeing his somewhat cramped position. Instead, withdrawing the bishop to e7 throws him on the defensive and lets White retain the initiative. } 7. Nbxd2 { Theorists and critics of master chess recommend that White capture with the queen instead. Despite their shrieks that the knight belongs at c3 in order to help attack the d5-square, the players themselves persist in recapturing with the knight. They advance as argument that in doing so another minor piece is developed, but the real reason might be sheer stubbornness – rebellion against authority. In any case, if it is less effective than 7 Qxd2, it is not to be so roundly condemned. } 7... O-O { Before taking any decisive action in the centre, Black sees to the welfare of his king and removes him to a safer part of the board. A strong alternative is 7...c5 challenging White’s pawn-centre. To this, White cannot reply 8 d5 as it loses a pawn. } 8. O-O { White makes his king’s position more secure and presses the h1-rook into service. } 8... c5! { A strong move, whose object is to undermine White’s centre. } 9. dxc5 { White has little choice. Moving the pawn to d5 loses a pawn, supporting it with 9 e3 (in order to recapture with a pawn and maintain a pawn in the centre), ties down the e-pawn to the job of defence. The chances then of the e-pawn’s ever reaching e4 are rather dubious. } 9... bxc5 { Black has gained three advantages by a simple exchange of pawns: 1) He has exchanged a centre pawn for a less central pawn. 2) His c-pawn controls d4, making it impossible for White to settle a piece on that square. 3) His queen and a1-rook will be able to operate with good effect on the newly opened b-file. } 10. Qc2 { In most cases the function of the queen in the opening is not so much to be moving around as it is to get off the back rank and out of the way, so that the rooks can get together and work on the centre files. With the departure of the queen, the f1-rook can occupy d1, exert pressure on the d-file, and make life uncomfortable for Black’s forces on that file. } 10... Nc6 { The knight develops toward the centre and intensifies the pawn’s grip on d4. } 11. Rfd1 { The tempting 11 e4 meets its refutation in 11...e5 (strengthening the pressure on d4) followed by 12...Qe7 and 13...Nd4. White would then face a problem: the pressure of the knight at d4 is almost intolerable, but removing it lets Black recapture by 14...cxd4, leaving him with a passed pawn on the d-file. } 11... Qb6! { Now there are three pieces bearing down on d4, while the queen herself gets a purchase on the open b-file. } 12. a3 { White has no wild dream of starting a counterattack with 13 b4; mainly he wants to rule out...Nb4 at some later stage. } 12... Rab8 { Fine positional play! One is apt to forget that a rook’s first duty is to seize upon any file that is open, not only since the rook’s attack extends the whole length of the file but because the rook has a convenient avenue for its progress to other points. } 13. Rab1 { White’s rook also goes to b1, but what a world of difference there is in the two moves! White’s rook has no open file; it has little prospect of increasing its mobility, and its function is purely defensive. In protecting the b-pawn, though, it relieves the queen of a responsibility. } 13... Rfc8 { The rook was doing nothing at f8, so it is transferred to a file where it is likely to become useful. There was no hurry about playing 13...a5 since White is in no position to try for the break by 14 b4. } 14. e4 { White’s move has a superficial appearance of strength. In reality, the pawn occupies a square that should be kept clear. White’s pieces lose a great deal of mobility in not being able to make use of e4 as a jumpingoff point to their various destinations. } 14... e5 { Stifling 15 e5, White’s e-pawn’s lust to expand. Notice how Black has reinforced his hold on d4. This point now has the power of the queen, a knight and a couple of pawns trained on it. } 15. Qd3 { White hopes for some counterplay along the d-file, either by 16 Qd6 or in manoeuvring his knight by way of f1 and e3 to d5. In the meantime, he prevents Black from playing 15...Nd4, the response to which is 16 Nxe5. } 15... d6 { A witty, almost impudent, reply. Black guards the e-pawn (so that he can play 16...Nd4) with a pawn which itself is unprotected! White, of course, must not take the d-pawn, the penalty for 16 Qxd6 being 16...Rd8, winning the queen. } 16. Nf1 { Indicating that he wants to deploy the knight to e3 and then d5. Excellent strategy, if White can carry it out. } 16... Nd4! { However, Black gets there first! Not only does he establish an outpost at d4, but he also hinders White from continuing his manoeuvre. If White tries 17 Ne3, then 17...Bxe4 18 Nd5 Bxd3 19 Nxb6 Nxf3+ 20 Bxf3 Rxb6 21 Rxd3 e4 wins a piece neatly. } 17. Nxd4 { The advanced knight cramps his style, so White gets rid of it. } 17... exd4 { Black is happy to exchange: he has a passed pawn on the d-file, which in the course of time might become a queen. More than that, the pawn guards the exits. It hinders White’s knight from coming out at e3 and puts an end to its ambition to reach d5. The passed pawn at d4 is apparently the logical candidate for promotion to queen, but there are surprises to come – many of them! } 18. b4 { Suddenly White bursts forth! His chief threat is 19 bxc5 Qxc5 (Black must recapture with the queen, as she is doubly attacked) 20 Rxb7 Rxb7 21 e5, and the discovered attack will net White two pieces for a rook. How does Black meet this threat? Obviously not with 18...cxb4, as 19 Rxb4 gives White the better of it. Also not by 18...Qc7, when after 19 bxc5 dxc5 (to protect the passed pawn) 20 f4 threatening 21 e5 follows, and White’s pieces spring to life. Capablanca’s actual reply initiates a remarkable combination. He lets White obtain an advantage in material in return for a position which looks far from promising – except to a Capablanca! } 18... Qc6! { Triple attack on the e-pawn! This forces White either to defend the pawn tamely, or else to go ahead boldly with the combination he planned. } 19. bxc5 { White plays to win! He takes a pawn off, opens a file for his rook, and threatens to remove the passed d-pawn. } 19... dxc5 { Black must recapture with the pawn to preserve the precious passed pawn. } 20. Rxb7 { This tempting combination wins two pieces for a rook. Has Capablanca been caught off-guard, or does he see much further into the resources of the position than his opponent? } 20... Qxb7 { Black captures with the queen to maintain control of the valuable open file. } 21. e5 { Discovered attack on the queen, and direct attack on the knight. } 21... Qb3! { A remarkable offer to exchange queens! Usually, the side that is ahead in material tries to clear the board and simplify to an ending. } 22. exf6 { White rejects 22 Qxb3 as it leads to 22...Rxb3 23 exf6 Rxa3, when Black is left with two passed pawns. } 22... Qxd3 { The idea of this is to force the white rook off the last rank. The rank then becomes available to Black’s rook as a point of entry, enabling it to get behind White’s pawns. } 23. Rxd3 { White has no choice. } 23... Rb1! { The knight is pinned as a start, and White has to scramble frantically to break the pin. Against passive play, Black continues with 24...Re8 followed by 25...Ree1 and 26...Rec1. This wins the c-pawn since White cannot protect it by 27 Bd5 without abandoning the knight. After capturing the pawn, Black would have two dangerous connected pawns rushing to become queens. } 24. Bd5 { White’s plan is clear: he protects the precious c-pawn and vacates a square for his king. Following 25 Kg2, the knight, no longer pinned, can come into the game. } 24... Rcb8 { The doubled rooks give Black undisputed possession of the all-important b-file. White is now faced with two threats: 1) 25...Rc1 intending 26...Rbb1. The attack on the knight would compel the bishop to return to g2, whereupon Black picks up the c-pawn. 2) 25...R8b3, forcing an exchange of rooks, after which one of White’s queenside pawns must fall. } 25. Kg2 { White unpins the knight, which has been a spectator for the last ten moves. } 25... R8b3! { A daring concept! Black offers to exchange rooks and let White remain with two pieces to his one! } 26. Rxb3 { White is happy to oblige! } 26... Rxb3 { Now the a-pawn is in peril. } 27. Nd2 { White could not save the a-pawn (if 27 a4, then 27...Rb4 28 a5 Ra4), so the knight counterattacks by going after a pawn. } 27... Rxa3 { Winning a pawn and simultaneously creating a passed pawn on the a-file. Will this be the one to become a queen? } 28. Ne4 { Now White’s pieces spring into action! The threat is 29 Nxc5, knocking the support out from under the d-pawn and giving himself a passed c-pawn. } 28... a5! { Much better than 28...Ra5 which ties the rook down to defending a pawn and makes his role in the ending a subordinate one. } 29. Nxc5 { After this capture, White’s own passed pawn begins to look menacing. } 29... gxf6 { Not so much to gain a pawn as to give the king more freedom. If at once 29...Kf8, then 30 Nd7+ drives the king back to g8, as 30...Ke8 allows 31 fxg7 winning for White. 29...d3 allows 30 Kf3 followed by 31 Ke3, when White wins the d-pawn. } 30. Kf1 { The king turns back to head off the passed pawns. } 30... a4 { Black does not fear a double attack on this pawn by 31 Bc6. He would refute this by 31...Ra1+ followed by 32...a3, and the pawn has moved another step forward. } 31. Ke2 { The king comes closer, definitely putting an end to any danger from the d-pawn. How does Black proceed? } 31... Ra1! { By scaring White with the threat of queening the a-pawn! Black intends 32...a3, followed by 33...a2, 34...Re1+ (to make way for the pawn without loss of time) and 35...a1Q. } 32. Nd3 { White blockades the d-pawn and prepares to advance his own passed pawn. } 32... a3 { Back at the seventeenth move it seemed that the d-pawn would reach the eighth rank and become a queen. The d-pawn is blockaded, and it now appears that the a-pawn is the one that will be promoted. But will it be the a-pawn? } 33. c5 { White’s pawn can cause trouble, too! } 33... a2 { Threatening to win on the spot by 34...Re1+ 35 Nxe1 a1Q. } 34. Kf3 { The king steps aside to evade the check. } 34... Rd1 { This move, which attacks the knight as well as threatening to queen the pawn, adds to White’s difficulties. } 35. Bxa2 { White must destroy this dangerous creature at all costs! } 35... Rxd3+ { With this capture Black nets a piece for his a-pawn. } 36. Ke4 { White does not fall into the trap 36 Ke2 losing his passed pawn after 36...Rc3. } 36... Rd2 { The text-move attacks the bishop and the f-pawn. Moreover, it revives the d-pawn’s prospects. Is this pawn to be the candidate after all? } 37. Bc4! { An admirable spot for the bishop. Black can now easily go wrong by 37...Rxf2 38 c6 Rb2 (if 38...Rc2, then 39 Kd5 wins for White) 39 c7, and White’s pawn crashes through! } 37... Kf8! { The king takes over the job of restraining the dangerous pawn. } 38. f3 { Advancing the c-pawn is useless: 38 c6 Ke7 and the pawn can go no further. With the text-move, White offers his h-pawn in return for Black’s d-pawn. } 38... Rxh2 { Black falls in with the suggestion. Instead of grimly holding on to the passed pawn, he is willing to simplify, confident that his superiority is enough to secure the win. This requires a belief in justice on the chessboard, and confidence in one’s ability to mete it out properly. } 39. Kxd4 { With this capture, White’s prospects look brighter. His king and bishop are in close attendance on the passed pawn and will bend all their efforts to escort it to the far side of the board. } 39... Ke7 { Ready to blockade the pawn. } 40. Bd3 { Apparently with the idea of switching the bishop to e4. From there it guards his f-pawn, prevents Black’s doubled pawns from advancing, and is prepared to protect his c-pawn when it reaches c6. } 40... h5 { Threatening 41...Rg2 42 g4 h4, when Black wins. Is the h-pawn to be the passed pawn that becomes a queen? } 41. Ke3 { The king comes closer to rescue the g-pawn. } 41... Rg2 { In forcing the king to defend the g-pawn, Black draws him farther away from his own passed pawn. } 42. Kf4 { The only move. Against 42 g4 the win is easy: 42...h4 43 Bf1 Rc2 44 Kd4 Rf2 45 Bh3 Rxf3 46 Bg2 Rg3 47 Bf1 h3, etc. } 42... Rg1 { Now to get behind the passed pawn! In the ending, the rook does its best work behind the enemy’s pawns. Its power to strike extends all along the line, so that no matter how far the pawn advances on the file, it can never escape from the rook’s attack. } 43. Be4 { Preparing to protect the pawn when it reaches c6. If at once 43 c6, then 43...Rc1 44 Be4 (but not 44 Bb5 Rc5 45 Ba4 Rc4+ winning the bishop), and we have the position reached a little later in the game by a transposition of moves. } 43... Rc1 { To the uninitiated, this appears strange! Why help the pawn move farther up the board? Black’s idea is to compel the pawn to move to a light square. This will tie the bishop down to its defence and considerably limit the bishop’s sphere of activity. } 44. c6 { The pawn moves up to come under the bishop’s protection. } 44... Rc3! { A tremendously effective move! It reduces White to a state of zugzwang – compulsion to move. What this means is that White might hold the game, except that he must make a move, and any move he makes is fatal because it disturbs the position unfavourably! } 45. c7 { Voluntarily giving up the pawn he cannot save! The alternatives are extremely interesting: 1) 45 Kf5 Rc5+ (to drive the king back) 46 Kf4 Ke6 47 Ke3 (a bishop move loses the pawn at once, while 47 g4 allows 47...h4 giving Black a passed pawn) 47...f5 48 Bd3 Rxc6 and Black wins. 2) 45 Bd5 Rc5 46 Ke4 (46 Be4 Ke6 leads to play as in line ‘1’) 46...f5+ 47 Kd4 Rxd5+! 48 Kxd5 f4! 49 Kc5 (or 49 gxf4 h4 50 Kc5 Kd8 51 Kb6 Kc8 wins) 49...fxg3 50 Kb6 g2 51 c7 g1 Q+ 52 Kb7 Qb1+ 53 Kc8 Qb6 54 f4 Qa7 55 f5 Qa8#. } 45... Rxc7 { Removing a potential danger. The ending still requires winning, and the manner of achieving the win is an illustration of smooth, flawless technique. The demonstration is as lucid and accurate as though it were the solution of a composed endgame study. } 46. Bd5 { To keep Black from moving his king to the fine square e6. } 46... Rc5 { The rook intends to pursue the bishop until it leaves the diagonal overlooking the e6-square. } 47. Ba2 { Understandably, the bishop tries to stay on the diagonal as long as possible. If instead 47 Bb3, then 47...Rb5 forces 48 Ba2 (48 Bc4 Rb4 pins the bishop, while 48 Ba4 Rb4+ also wins the bishop) 48...Rb2 49 Bd5 Rb4+! 50 Kf5 (50 Be4 Ke6 51 Ke3 f5 wins, or if 50 Ke3 then 50...f5 followed by 51... Kf6 and Black wins) 50...Rb5 51 Ke4 f5+ 52 Kd4 Rxd5+! 53 Kxd5 f4 54 gxf4 h4, when the pawn cannot be stopped! } 47... Rb5! { Complete domination! The bishop has no moves! } 48. Ke3 { Or 48 Ke4 f5+ 49 Kf4 Kf6 50 Ke3 (the bishop cannot move, and 50 g4 loses to 50...hxg4 51 fxg4 Rb4+ 52 Kf3 fxg4+) 50...Rb4 51 Bd5 f4+ 52 gxf4 h4 53 Kf2 Rb2+ 54 Kg1 Kf5 55 Bxf7 Kxf4 56 Bd5 Kg3 57 Be4 Ra2 58 Kf1 h3 and Black wins. } 48... Ra5 { Allowing the bishop one square on the a2-g8 diagonal. } 49. Bc4 { The bishop could not go to b3 on account of the ensuing pin, and 49 Bb1 is answered by 49...Ke6 50 Kf4 Ra4+ 51 Ke3 (51 Be4 f5 wins the bishop) 51...f5 52 Bc2 f4+ 53 gxf4 (or 53 Kd2 fxg3) 53...Ra3 + 54 Kd2 Ra2 55 Kc1 Rxc2+ and Black wins. } 49... Rc5 { Dislodging the bishop from the diagonal leading to e6. } 50. Ba6 { 50 Kd4 Rg5 wins a pawn at once, while 50 Ba2 is refuted by 50...f5, clearing f6 for Black’s king. } 50... Ke6 { Another step nearer the centre and White’s remaining pawns. } 51. Kf4 { White puts up a hard fight! He is ready to pounce on 51...f5 with 52 Kg5. } 51... Rc3! { Again restricting White to a move by the bishop. Playing 52 Ke4 succumbs to 52..f5+ 53 Kf4 Kf6, etc. } 52. Bf1 { White must keep watch over c4, otherwise (if he plays 52 Bb7, for example) 52...Rc4+ forces his king to retreat while Black’s can advance. } 52... f5 { Finally! This pawn moves up a square and vacates f6 for the king. } 53. Ba6 { The number of moves White has left is dwindling! 53 g4 fxg4 54 fxg4 h4 55 g5 h3 56 Kg4 h2 57 Bg2 Rc1 wins for Black, while after 53 Kg5 Rxf3 54 Bc4+ Ke5 55 Kh4 f4 Black again wins easily. } 53... Kf6 { Stalemating White’s king. What remains now is to force him back to the third rank while Black’s king moves up to the fourth. } 54. Bb7 { If the bishop stays on the longer diagonal, for instance by 54 Be2, Black plays 54...Rb3 and then drives the king back by 55...Rb4+. } 54... Rc4+ { Compelling the king to retreat. } 55. Ke3 { The only move. } 55... Kg5 { With the pretty threat 56...f4+ 57 Kd3 (57 gxf4+ Rxf4 gives Black a passed pawn, while 57 Kf2 Rc2+ 58 Kg1 fxg3 gives him two) 57...fxg3 58 Kxc4 Kf4!, and Black wins neatly. } 56. Kf2 { A thrust at the rook by 56 Bd5 allows this finish: 56...f4+ 57 Ke2 Rc2+ 58 Kd3 Rc7 (simple but brutal), and Black wins. With the text-move, White retreats in order to head off the potential passed pawn, whichever one that may be! } 56... f4! { This is the key move in all cases! Black threatens to win at once by 57...Rc2 + 58 Kg1 fxg3. } 57. Kg2 { Ready to reply to the check with 58 Kh3 saving the pawn. } 57... f5! { Passed pawns must be pushed. This pawn, which stood patiently at f7 for 56 moves, is, believe it or not, the one that was destined to become the passed pawn that wins the game! White does not wait for the proof: After 58 Kh3 fxg3 59 Kxg3 h4+ (a likely-looking candidate, but not the final choice) 60 Kh3 Rc3 61 Bd5 Kf4 62 Kxh4 Rxf3 63 Bxf3 Kxf3 64 Kh3 f4 65 Kh2 Khe2 the pawn marches straight through to be queened. The whole game is beautiful, and the ending so fascinating that I could not resist a detailed analysis of its many fine points. A study of it is far more rewarding in entertainment and instruction than the playing over of a host of ‘brilliancies’ that feature a flinging about of pieces in wanton display. } 0-1

1. d4 { This opening move, seizing the centre with a pawn and making room for two pieces to come out, is efficient. White intends to develop all his pieces as quickly as possible, posting each of them in one move on its most suitable square. He will make only those pawn moves that speed his development (by releasing pieces or attacking the centre) or hinder that of his opponent. } 1... Nf6 { Model development in every respect: the knight leaps in toward the centre where it has the greatest potential for attack, exerts immediate pressure on the important squares d5 and e4, and prevents White from establishing a strong pawn formation by 2 e4. } 2. Nf3 { White develops the kingside pieces first, to enable early castling on that side. At f3, the knight stands on its most useful square in the opening. It is beautifully placed for attack – notice how it supplements the pawn’s grip on e5 – and is a peerless defender of the kingside after White castles. } 2... d5 { Black cannot wrest the initiative by brute force. He may get it if White plays carelessly (wasting time in the opening or chasing after pawns) but against normal development Black must content himself with achieving equality. Black’s second move neutralizes White’s central pressure and opens lines for two of his own pieces. } 3. c4 { One of the rare occasions when a pawn move which does not aid development is opportune. This one attacks and threatens to eliminate, by 4 cxd5, Black’s centre. It does additional service in increasing the mobility (actual and potential) of White’s pieces. It clears a diagonal for the queen and assures the opening of the c-file for the later use of the queen or a1-rook. } 3... e6 { Black supports the d-pawn with another pawn. If White tries breaking up the centre by 4 cxd5, Black is prepared to recapture with a pawn, to keep the centre intact by maintaining a pawn at d5. Although 3...e6 has the drawback of shutting in the c8-bishop, it is still Black’s best move. The difficulty in developing the bishop effectively may not seem alarming, but if it is not overcome, it will amount to Black playing a piece short. For the present, in partial compensation, the f8-bishop has lots of elbow-room. } 4. Bg5 { This move has a terribly cramping effect on Black’s game. It clamps a pin on the knight and thereby exerts pressure on any pieces behind it. Black cannot move freely about while his kingside is gripped by the bishop. In the 19th century, White would more often have developed the dark-squared bishop at f4, where it commands a useful diagonal. Nowadays we look for sharper, more vigorous moves. If we can mobilize our forces and at the same time restrain the enemy’s development, we accomplish more than with routine, often innocuous, measures. The pin of the knight paralyses Black’s only developed piece. } 4... Be7 { Why all the fuss when the pin is so easily lifted? For one thing, in unpinning the knight, the bishop is restricted to a defensive, passive role. Its development has been dictated by the fact that White put pressure on the knight. Black’s play, incidentally, is in no way to be deprecated. The bishop’s move, modest as it is, is a step forward in the process of development. The bishop has left the last rank, taken up a strong defensive post, and cleared the kingside, enabling Black to castle. } 5. e3 { Pawns should be moved sparingly in the opening, but since some pawns must be moved to get the bishops into play, this must be regarded as a developing move. } 5... Nbd7 { In the Queen’s Gambit Declined, the ideal square for the development of the b8-knight is not c6 but d7. From d7, the knight supports an eventual thrust at White’s centre by the e-pawn or the c-pawn. The knight must not develop at c6, where it blocks the c-pawn. This pawn must not be prevented from advancing to c5, where it can dispute control of the centre. } 6. Nc3 { The white queen’s knight, contrariwise, is posted excellently at c3. It does not block the c-pawn and bears down on d5 and e4, two of the four important squares in the centre. } 6... O-O { Black transfers his king to a more secure location and brings his h8-rook closer to the centre files. } 7. Rc1 { The rook develops where it has the most attractive prospects for attack. At c1 it controls and will exert pressure all along the open c-file. The file is obstructed now by White’s own knight and pawn, but the pawn can be disposed of by an exchange and the knight can move and clear the file. Strictly speaking, the file is only partly open, but open or not, the rook goes to c1 because: Control of the c-file is absolutely vital in the Queen’s Gambit. } 7... Re8 { Black’s rook moves to a centre file, where it may play a useful part in any action that takes place in the centre. The rook’s presence on the file is of little consequence now, but with every clearance on the file, its influence grows stronger and stronger. Black’s game is cramped, but alternatives aimed at freeing it immediately are not convincing: 1) 7...dxc4 8 Bxc4 and White gains a tempo with this bishop, since it recaptures and develops at the same time. 2) 7...a6 (in order to continue with 8...dxc4 9 Bxc4 b5 10 Bd3 Bb7) 8 c5 can be very constraining. 3) 7...c5 8 dxc5 Nxc5 9 cxd5 exd5 (not9...Nxd5 10 Nxd5 exd5 11 Rxc5! Bxg5 12 Rxd5, when White wins the bishop) and Black’s d5-pawn is weak, while White has the fine d4-square as a central point for manoeuvring his pieces to any part of the board. } 8. Qc2 { The best place on the board for the queen! From c2 the queen increases the pressure on the c-file and seizes control of the centre, making the problem of freeing himself troublesome for Black. } 8... dxc4 { Black gets impatient and tries to break loose. It would have been better to delay this capture, though, and wait for White to move his f1-bishop. Then the recapture costs the bishop an extra move. Black might have played instead 8...c6, strengthening the position of the d5-pawn and offering the queen an outlet to the queenside. } 9. Bxc4 { Obviously a gain of time for White, whose light-squared bishop recaptures a pawn and develops to a good square simultaneously. } 9... c5 { Black must counterattack or be crushed to death. This offers the most practical chances in that he establishes tension in the centre and disputes control in that area. Furthermore, he prepares to oppose rooks on the c-file and fight for equal rights on the file. } 10. O-O { The simplest way to keep up the pressure is to continue developing. At one stroke White removes his king to a safer part of the board and brings the h1-rook out of the corner and toward the centre. } 10... cxd4 { Black’s intention is to force White to a decision regarding the centre. If White recaptures with a pawn, it saddles him with an isolated pawn in the middle of the board; if with a piece, then his pawn-centre is no better than Black’s. } 11. Nxd4 { Rubinstein prefers this to 11 exd4, which maintains a pawn, but one that is isolated, in the centre. The weakness of a pawn separated from its fellows lies not so much in the fact that the pawn can only be defended by pieces, but in the peculiar circumstance that enemy pieces can settle themselves on the square directly in front of the pawn (in this case d5) and stay there indefinitely, secure in the knowledge that no enemy pawns can drive them away. The strength of an isolated pawn in the centre (for instance at d4, if White recaptured by 11 exd4) consists of its control of the strategically important e5- and c5-squares, its ability to spearhead an attack to break up a position, and its value as a support for an outpost – in this case a knight at e5. } 11... a6 { Mainly to secure the b5-square from invasion by one of White’s minor pieces. The objection to this move is that pawn moves that do not contribute to development are a waste of valuable time in the opening. More to the point is 11... Ne5 12 Bb3 Bd7 13 Rfd1 Qb6, with a view to getting some action out of his pieces. Notice that White has made only those pawn moves which were necessary to release pieces, or which added to the mobility of pieces already developed. Every single move, of piece or pawn, furthered the development of White’s position and increased its potential energy. } 12. Rfd1 { Now the rook swings over to the centre, placing itself at the head of a file facing the queen. The queen is sure to feel uncomfortable, no matter how many pieces separate the two, as threats are constantly in the air. For instance, if Black should play the plausible 12...Nb6, attacking the bishop, the reply 13 Nxe6 wins the queen by a discovered (and double) attack. Yates and Winter comment admiringly at this point, “A classical example of correct development. White has brought his queen, rooks, bishops and one knight to almost ideal squares in one move each.” } 12... Qa5 { The queen flees the line of fire, gaining a little time by attacking a bishop. } 13. Bh4 { The bishop retreats but maintains pressure on the knight. } 13... Ne5 { Now the other bishop is threatened, apparently with more gain of time for Black. } 14. Be2 { Both bishops have been driven back, but, despite this, their latent power is enormous. The potential of two bishops working in harmony is not be to given up lightly, so White does not consider a move such as 14 Bd3 which lets Black play 14...Nxd3 and exchange a short-stepping knight for a long-range bishop. Condensed, it comes down to this: It is an advantage to keep both bishops. } 14... Ng6 { Swinging over to the kingside, the knight attacks the dark-squared bishop and forces it still further back. Meanwhile, more and more barriers are being put up about Black’s king, who now seems firmly entrenched in a bomb-proof shelter. Despite all the time Black seems to have gained in his attacks on the white bishops, he should have done something to get his queenside pieces off the ground, for instance by 14...Bd7 instead. Then the continuation 15 Nb3 Qc7 16 Qb1 Bc6 gives him reasonable fighting chances. } 15. Bg3 { The bishop must step back a square and relax its pressure on the knight, but now it commands a magnificent diagonal. Black cannot continue chasing the bishops in an effort to get rid of one of them since after 15...Nh5 16 Nb3 Qg5 (the queen must protect the knight) 17 Ne4 Qh6 18 Bc7 White dominates the board. } 15... e5 { An extremely attractive move! These are all the things the pawn does: 1) It occupies a square in the centre. 2) It opens a path for the c8-bishop. 3) It cuts down the scope of White’s g3-bishop. 4) It will drive off White’s knight from its centralized position. Against this, Black’s move offers one objection, seemingly a slight one. The d5-square, no longer under the pawn’s control, has been weakened. It offers White the prospect of utilizing this central point for the easy manoeuvring of his pieces to any part of the board. Will this one liability outweigh all the assets? It is this judgement of imponderables, where exact calculation is not possible, that makes chess a fascinating blend of art and science. } 16. Nb3 { The knight must leave but retaliates by getting in a thrust at the queen. } 16... Qc7 { The queen evades the attack, and Black prepares to regroup his pieces, perhaps by 17...Bd7, 18...Bc6 and 19...Rad8. } 17. Qb1! { This is White’s fifth retreating move in succession, but with every step backward his position improves! Though driven back to the first three ranks, his pieces will gain in dynamic energy. Gradually they will take up stronger positions, dominate the board, and put the enemy to flight. Black has no time now to develop his c8-bishop as after 17....Bd7 18 Nd5 Qd8 (if 18...Nxd5, then 19 Rxc7 Nxc7 20 Rxd7 wins) 19 Nc7 White wins the exchange. } 17... Qb8 { Black’s queen was forced to retreat (by the threat of a discovered attack) while White’s queen moved to b1 voluntarily. The difference in the positions is apparent: 1) White’s queen does not obstruct the rooks, which together control the two open files; Black’s queen and bishop separate his rooks, one of which is completely shut in, while the other’s action is severely limited. 2) White has two agile, longrange bishops; Black has one, with the other undeveloped and still at home. 3) White’s queen can leap into the fray quickly; Black’s must skulk on the fringes of the board. } 18. Bf3 { The bishop seizes the long diagonal and prevents Black from playing 18...b5 (the punishment being 19 Bxa8) and then fianchettoing his bishop. } 18... Qa7 { Black’s manoeuvring is tortuous, but evidently he wants to bring his rook to b8, then play ...b5, and finally develop his queen’s bishop at b7. } 19. Na5! { A fine preventive move! It stops 19...Rb8 followed by 20...b5 as then 21 Nc6 wins the exchange, while the direct 19...Bd7 or 19...Be6 costs Black his b-pawn. Notice how White not only sees to the development of his own pieces but hinders that of his opponent. } 19... Bb4 { Black tries to chase off the knight, which is hampering the free movement of his queenside pieces. } 20. Nc4 { The knight must leave, but in compensation it enjoys the advantage of being nearer the centre. } 20... Bd7 { The bishop moves to the only square available for its development! If Black tries instead 20...Be6, then 21 Nxe5 wins a pawn, while on 20...Bg4 21 Bxg4 Nxg4 22 Nd5 the threats of 23 Nxb4 (winning a piece) and 23 Nc7 (winning the exchange) cannot both be met. } 21. Nd5! { The knight leaps to d5 and attacks pieces all over the place! It threatens one bishop directly (by 22 Nxb4) and the other indirectly, by 22 Nxf6+ gxf6 23 Rxd7. In addition to this, it threatens 22 Nc7 , attacking both rooks and thereby winning the exchange. } 21... Nxd5 { Obviously, such a dangerous beast must be removed! } 22. Bxd5 { White recaptures with the threat of 23 Bxf7+ Kxf7 24 Rxd7+, winning a pawn. He gains a tempo with this, as Black must drop whatever he is doing to parry the threat. } 22... Be6 { Black must rid the board of the terrible bishop which attacks his kingside and restrains his queenside. It would not do to play 22...Bc6 as 23 Bxc6 bxc6 24 Qe4 wins the c-pawn or the e-pawn. } 23. Qe4! { A master move in every respect, and a one-move lesson in positional play! Where most of us think of an exchange in terms of what happens after 23 Bxe6, the great master visualizes an exchange as an opportunity to substitute another piece for one that must come off the board. White is willing to exchange, but only if he can be assured of keeping control of d5 by replacing the bishop with another piece. Let me reword this, so that the message is unmistakable: Supporting a piece under attack (here the bishop at d5) puts more pressure on Black, where a direct exchange or a retreat might relieve it. Note incidentally the full effect of the queen’s magnificent centralization, and her radiation of power in so many directions: 1) The queen supports the bishop at d5. 2) The queen adds to the bishop’s attack on the b-pawn. 3) The queen helps in the attack on the e-pawn. 4) The queen threatens (indirectly) Black’s b4-bishop. } 23... Bxd5 { Practically forced in view of the many threats. An attempt to drive the queen off by 23...f5 is brusquely refuted by 24 Qxf5 and Black (whose bishop is pinned) is unable to take the queen. } 24. Rxd5 { Black rids himself of one troublesome piece only to have another one take its place! For the third time, White anchors a piece at d5, each time intensifying his grip on the position. Now there is a fourfold attack on the e-pawn, by rook, knight, bishop and queen. While this pawn is being rescued, White will gain the time needed to double his rooks on the d-file, guaranteeing him permanent possession of this vital highway. The effect on Black will be to cut communication between his forces, making an organized resistance difficult. } 24... Rac8 { Protecting the pawn indirectly by pinning one of its attackers. White cannot take the pawn with the knight on pain of mate, nor with the rook or the queen, as that results in loss of material to White. This leaves 25 Bxe5, and Black is ready to punish that with 25...f6 26 Bd4 Rxe4 27 Bxa7 Rexc4, when he has gained a piece. } 25. Rcd1 { Doubling the rooks on an open file, an act that more than doubles the strength of the rooks. White’s knight is now unpinned, and the attack on the e-pawn renewed, with incidentally a threat of discovered attack on the bishop. White has a won game theoretically, and Rubinstein wins it in a way that is both efficient and artistic. } 25... Bf8 { Black transfers the exposed bishop to the defence. Against the immediate counterattack by 25...f5, White has a winning continuation in 26 Qxf5 Rxc4 27 Rd8! Rxd8 28 Rxd8+ Nf8 29 Qe6+ Kh8 30 Qxc4, when he is the exchange ahead. After Black’s actual move, he can answer 26 Nxe5 with 26...f6, winning the unfortunate knight. In addition, he contemplates the thrust 26...f5, which after 27 Qd3 (to protect the knight) 27...f4 occasions some trouble for the bishop. } 26. b3 { Frees the queen from the duty of guarding the knight and stops any such move as 26...f5, when the pawn would simply be snapped up. Against passive play, White will continue by 27 Rd7, invading the seventh rank. } 26... b5 { The object of this is not so much to dislodge the knight as it is to open a line for the queen, enabling her to return to the kingside and the defence of the king. } 27. Nd6! { A knight fork which will force an exchange – a simplification to White’s advantage. He will maintain the pressure inherent in a superior position without running the risk of being involved in unnecessary complications. A premature attack, in fact, might even result in a loss for White! Consider this pretty possibility (instead of the actual move): 27 Nxe5 f6 28 Rd7 (apparently a saving move, as White attacks the queen and threatens to follow with 29 Qd5+ unpinning his knight) 28...Qxd7! and Black wins! The recapture by the rook allows Black to mate, while 29 Nxd7 Rxe4 leaves Black a rook ahead. } 27... Bxd6 { Black had no choice, as the knight attacked both his rooks. } 28. Rxd6 { The recapture vacates the d5square for occupation by the queen; the tripling of heavy pieces on the d-file would increase the advantage that White already has. However, an even more potent threat is the possibility of establishing a beachhead on the seventh rank by 29 Rd7. The posting of a rook on the seventh rank, in the middlegame or the ending, is a tremendous positional advantage. } 28... Rc7 { Black does what he can to keep the enemy rook out and seals up all the entrances. White has the superior position, but how does he break through? Let us listen in on what Rubinstein might say to himself in reasoning out a course of action: My rooks are as well placed as they can be and doing a good job in controlling the open d-file. My queen is strongly centralized and exerts pressure in every direction. My bishop bears down on his e-pawn and keeps a rook and knight chained to its defence. My pieces are all usefully occupied and must stay where they are. How about my opponent? His defence just about holds together, but his pieces must stay where they are to guard his weak points. If I leave him alone, he might consolidate his forces, and even counterattack. If I leave him alone... Say, isn’t that the key to the position? I must not leave him alone! I must interfere with the arrangement of his pieces. I must drive them off from their present positions. In fact, I might ruin his game by driving off even one defender! Since my pieces are all useful where they are, I must not disturb them but look to my pawns to break up the defence. Which pawn shall I use, and which of his pieces shall I try to dislodge? The first thing to do is to find a target. His queen and rooks are too far away and too agile to be bothered by pawns. Any of them can move off to a different square on a file or a rank and still control it. I must aim at a fixed target – some piece that is needed at the spot where it is stationed and loses its effectiveness as soon as it is displaced. How about the knight? Suppose I played 29 h4 and gave it a nudge by 30 h5? It would have to leave its fine defensive position immediately. Where could it go? If to e7, it blocks the action of the e8-rook, and if it retreats to the back rank, it is out of play for a time. Besides, I get another benefit in moving the h-pawn. It gives my king a flight square, so that he doesn’t fall into a surprise mate on the first rank. } 29. h4! { This is the key to the decisive attack! The obvious threat is 30 h5, dislodging the knight, and then capturing the e-pawn. The ulterior purpose is to compel Black to protect the endangered pawn by 29...f6, weakening the cordon of pawns near his king. Further weaknesses may then be induced by h5 and h6, attacking the g-pawn. } 29... f6 { Clearly, to give the e-pawn the solid support only another pawn affords. The alternative 29...Rce7 succumbs to 30 Qc6 followed by 31 Rd8, with an easy win, while 29...h5 (to prevent 30 h5) allows 30 Qf5, winning the h-pawn. } 30. Qd5+ { Simple and strong! The queen makes a powerful entrance at d5, seizing control of a diagonal leading to the king and at the same time tripling heavy pieces on the open central file. Notice the admirable use of d5 as a pivot for the manoeuvring of the various pieces. It has been occupied in turn by knight, bishop, rook and queen – aptly enough, in order of strength! } 30... Kh8 { Hoping for safety in the corner. If instead 30...Rf7, then 31 h5 Nh8 32 h6 decisively breaks up Black’s defensive pawn wall, or if 30...Kf8, then 31 h5 Nh8 32 Rd8 Nf7 33 Rxe8+ Kxe8 34 Qe6+ Kf8 35 h6 Re7 (nothing else saves the game, as 35...Nxh6 allows mate on the move, and 35...gxh6 36 Qxf6 leads to ruin for Black) 36 Qc8+ Re8 37 hxg7+, and White wins a rook. } 31. h5 { This move not only evicts the knight from its strong defensive post but also drives a wedge into Black’s position. } 31... Nf8 { Against the only other possibility, 31...Ne7, White wins easily by 32 Qf7 with a million threats. Let’s take a look at some interesting possibilities then: 1) 32...Rg8 33 h6 (threatening 34 Rd8 followed by mate at g7) 33...Nf5 34 hxg7+ Nxg7 35 Qxf6 and Black both loses a pawn and falls into a deadly pin. 2) 32...Qb8 33 h6 gxh6 34 Qxf6+ Kg8 35 Bxe5 Ng6 36 Rd7 with a quick mate. 3) 32...Rcc8 33 h6 gxh6 34 Bh4, threatening 35 Bxf6#. Black cannot guard against that mate by a knight move as it leaves his queen en prise. How many of these variations did White foresee? And how many did Black know he was avoiding when he moved his knight to f8 instead of to e7? The answer is – probably none! A good player can, almost at a glance, sense the effect of a move that is obviously decisive. He saves himself a great deal of valuable time when he does not even bother about analysing the resources of such a defence as 31...Ne7. The fact that it permits such a paralysing entrance into the vitals as 32 Qf7 practically rules it out from more than fleeting consideration. } 32. h6 { White drives the wedge in still further. White’s object is to break up the pawn position around Black’s king. If Black’s g-pawn can be uprooted, it will make the f-pawn, the keystone of his game, vulnerable to attack. And if that falls. Black’s whole position falls with it. White’s immediate threat is 33 hxg7+ Kxg7 34 Bh4 Rf7 35 Qc6, with an attack on the e8-rook and a triple attack on the f-pawn. } 32... Ng6 { Black gets his knight back into active play and prevents White from striking again at the f-pawn by 33 Bh4. He side-steps the pretty loss 32...gxh6 33 Rxf6 Rd7 34 Bxe5! Rxd5 (if 34...Rxe5, 35 Rxf8+ and mate next move) 35 Rxf8# – double check and mate! } 33. Qe6! { A spectacular move! White is not playing to the gallery in offering a queen sacrifice. All that he wants is to penetrate still deeper into the heart of Black’s position, and this is the simplest way to do so. The move is brilliant nevertheless, and making a move of this sort (even vicariously) gives one a thrill. I must warn the player who likes the excitement of springing a surprise move on his opponent that it is a waste of time to look for brilliant moves in the course of a game unless the position warrants it. You must first get an advantage, however slight. Work on increasing the advantage until you have built up a position that is definitely superior. Once you have established your right to look for combinations, the brilliant moves will come of themselves. White of course does not expect Black to take his queen and allow 34 Rd8+ and a quick mate. What he has in mind primarily is to secure complete control of d7, an important square for his rooks to exploit. One of the most interesting things to me in the position is that White threatens his opponent with disaster on three ranks: 1) On the eighth rank by 34 Qxe8+ followed by mate. 2) On the seventh rank by 34 Rd7 followed by 35 hxg7#. 3) On the sixth rank by 34 hxg7+ Kxg7 35 Qxf6+, winning easily. } 33... Rf8 { There isn’t too much choice, in view of all the threats. Black’s move gives the f-pawn added protection. } 34. Rd7 { Threatening 35 hxg7# – mate on the move! } 34... gxh6 { 34...Rxd7 is no better since the recapture 35 Rxd7 threatens mate on one side, and the queen on the other. White also forces mate after 34...Rg8 35 hxg7+ Rxg7 36 Rd8+. } 35. Bh4! { The bishop, which has stood in one spot for twenty-five moves, applies the finishing touch! The threat is 36 Bxf6+ xRf6 37 Qxf6+ Kg8 38 Qg7#. If 35...Nxh4, then 36 Qe7 threatens 37 Qxf8#, 37 Qg7# or 37 Qxh7#, and no one can survive such a display of feminine power! An impressive, deeply satisfying game, one of the finest in the literature of chess. } 1-0
