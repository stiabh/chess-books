{
It is not the purpose of this book to bewilder you with magical effects; it is to show you how they are produced.

Take the popular kingside attack; it is attractive because it features combinative play with its brilliant sacrifices and surprise moves. It is appealing because it aims for quick checkmate and lets you play startling moves to bring it about.

But when and how do you start a kingside attack? Must you wait for an inspiration?

The answer is simple and may be surprising, so let us look behind the scenes:

The diagram shows a castled position. The king is protected by a knight at f3 and the three pawns in front of him. While these protectors stay where they are, the king is highly resistant to attack. The moment the formation is changed, the structure is loosened and weakened. *It is then vulnerable to attack.* 

The position may change when a player advances h2-h3 voluntarily to prevent a pin, or when he plays g3 to dislodge an enemy piece, but where this does not happen, the master (and here is the secret) *induces or compels by various threats the advance of the h-pawn or the g-pawn.*  Once either pawn makes a move, it creates a weakness in the defensive structure which can be exploited. It is then that the master embarks on a kingside attack and achieves his brilliant – yes, magical – effects.

The game von Scheve-Teichmann (No. 1) shows what happens when White plays h3 instinctively to prevent a pin. Teichmann fixes on the pawn that stepped out of line and makes it the object of his attack. Eventually he sacrifices a bishop for the h-pawn in order to break into the position with his other pieces.

Liubarski-Soultanbéieff (No. 2) also has White playing h3 in fear of a pin, and Black punishes him by a pawn attack beginning with ...h6! (Why this move of the h-pawn is good, and White’s is bad, is explained in the game.)

In Colle-Delvaux (No. 3) Colie forces ...h6 and then cleverly induces ...g6. After this, a knight sacrifice demolishes the weakened position.

Black plays ...h6 of his own free will to stave off an unlikely attack in Blackburne-Blanchard (No. 4). Blackburne sacrifices a bishop to remove Black’s indiscreet h-pawn and forces an entrance into the enemy camp.

Ruger-Gebhard (No. 5) illustrates the danger of castling prematurely, coupled with neglect of the centre. When Black adds an attack on a piece with ...h6 to his other sins, he is punished by a sacrifice that rips open a file against his king.

Zeissl-Walthoffen (No. 6) is another instance of untimely castling coupled with disregard for the importance of the centre. White is compelled to play g3, weakening the light squares no longer guarded by the pawn. Walthoffen’s pieces utilize these squares to work their way into the position and get at the king.

In the game Spielmann-Wahle (No. 7), Black advances his g-pawn to prevent a knight settling too close to his king. This deprives his own knight on f6 of the pawn’s stout support and creates weaknesses on the squares no longer under the pawn’s surveillance. Spielmann’s pieces invade, fasten themselves on the weak squares and deliver mate.

Przepiorka-Prokeš (No. 8) is an illustration of ...g6 being forced, with a resultant weakening of the dark squares. Przepiorka takes the precaution of destroying the bishop that travels on the dark squares (to accentuate the weakness) before launching the decisive attack.

The game between Znosko-Borovsky and Mackenzie (No. 9) shows Black trying to keep an enemy knight out of his territory by playing ...g6. He succeeds, but at the cost of weakening the dark squares near his king. White finds them convenient for his own pieces, which take turns in occupying the critical squares.

Tarrasch-Eckart (No. 10) is an interesting example of the danger incurred in playing mechanical chess. Black is compelled to play ...f5 and then ...g6, after which he succumbs to a bishop sacrifice which removes all the pawns guarding his king.

The next two games are delightful miniatures with a lot of meat in them. Flohr-Pitschak (No. 11) is a fascinating illustration of the process of chipping away at the king’s guards to impel them to move. Pitschak forces the g-pawn to advance, then the h-pawn, after which he crashes through the barriers with a queen sacrifice.

Pitschak-Flohr (No. 12), in which Flohr gets his revenge, has White playing h3 to evict a bishop. It leads to the loss of the pawn and the entrance of Flohr’s queen uncomfortably close to White’s king. The concentration of attack that follows leaves White with one solitary pawn to defend his king.

In Dobias-Podgorny (No. 13), Dobias compels the advance of the g-pawn, then the h-pawn. Then he subtly undermines the weakened position and causes it to collapse.

Tarrasch-Mieses (No. 14) shows Tarrasch destroying the f6-knight, Black’s best defender of a castled position, and uprooting the g-pawn in the process. The disruption of the pawn formation makes things easy for Tarrasch, who caps the victory with a quiet little pawn move. 

The next two games do not belong, strictly speaking, in the category of kingside attacks. I include them to show the consequences of failure to provide for the safety of the king.

Alekhine-Poindle (No. 15) has some delightfully unconventional moves by Alekhine to punish time-wasting play. Black is hindered from castling, and his king kept in the centre, where it is exposed to a fatal attack.

Tarrasch-Kurschner (No. 16) is a short story depicting harsh treatment of plausible but perfunctory chess. Tarrasch punishes his opponent’s infractions of principle by driving his pieces back where they interfere with each other, prevents Black’s king from castling and then assails him with every piece available.

{ The chief object of all opening strategy is to get the pieces out quickly – off the back rank and into active play. You cannot attack (let alone try to checkmate) with one or two pieces. You must develop all of them, as each one has a job to do. A good way to begin is to release two pieces at one stroke, and this can be done by advancing one of the centre pawns. }
1. e4 { This is an excellent opening move. White anchors a pawn in the centre of the board and opens lines for his queen and a bishop. His next move, if he is allowed, will be 2 d4. The two pawns will then control four squares on the fifth rank, c5, d5, e5 and f5, and prevent Black from placing any of his pieces on those important squares. How shall Black reply to White’s first move? He must not waste time considering meaningless moves, such as l ...h6 or l ...a6. These and other aimless moves do nothing toward developing the pieces, nor do they interfere with White’s threat to monopolize the centre. Black must fight for an equal share of the good squares. Black must dispute possession of the centre. Why all this stress on the centre? Why is it so important? Pieces placed in the centre enjoy the greatest freedom of action and have the widest scope for their attacking powers. A knight, for example, posted in the centre, reaches out in eight directions and attacks eight squares. Standing at the side of the board, its range of attack is limited to four squares. It is only half a knight! Occupation of the centre means control of the most valuable territory. It leaves less room for the enemy’s pieces, and makes defence difficult, as his pieces tend to get in each other’s way. Occupation of the centre, or control of it from a distance, sets up a barrier that divides the opponent’s forces and prevents them from cooperating harmoniously. Resistance by an army thus disunited is usually not very effective. } 1... e5 { Very good! Black insists on a fair share of the centre. He fixes a pawn firmly there and liberates two of his pieces. } 2. Nf3! { Absolutely the best move on the board! The knight develops with a threat – attack on a pawn. This gains time as Black is not free to develop as he pleases. He must save the pawn before he does anything else, and this cuts down his choice of reply. The knight develops towards the centre, which increases the scope of his attack. The knight exerts pressure on two of the strategically important squares in the centre, e5 and d4. The knight comes into play early in the game, in compliance with the precept: develop knights before bishops! One reason for the cogency of this principle is that the knight takes shorter steps than the bishop. It takes longer for him to get to the fighting area. The bishop can sweep the length of the chessboard in one move (notice how the f1-bishop can reach all the way to a6). Where the knight takes a hop, skip and jump to get to b5, the bishop makes it in one leap. Another purpose in developing the knights first is that we are fairly sure where they belong in the opening. We know that they are most effective on certain squares. We are not always certain of the right spot for the bishop. We may want the bishop to command a long diagonal, or we may prefer to have it pin an enemy piece. So: bring out your knights before developing the bishops! At this point you will note that Black must defend his e-pawn before going about his business. There are several ways to protect the pawn. He must evaluate and choose from these possibilities: 2...f6; 2...Qf6; 2...Qe7; 2...Bd6; 2...d6; and 2...Nc6. How does Black decide on the right move? Must he analyse countless combinations and try to visualize every sort of attack and defence for the next ten or fifteen moves? Let me hasten to assure you that a master does not waste valuable time on futile speculation. Instead, he makes use of a potent secret weapon – positional judgement. Applying it enables him to eliminate from consideration inferior moves, to which the average player devotes much thought. He hardly glances at moves that are obviously violations of principle! Here is what might go through his mind as he selects the right move: 2...f6: “Terrible! My f-pawn occupies a square that should be reserved for the knight and it also blocks the queen’s path along the diagonal. And I’ve moved a pawn when I should be developing pieces.” 2...Qf6: “Bad, since my knight belongs at f6, not the queen. Also, I’m wasting the power of my strongest piece to defend a pawn.” 2...Qe7 : “This shuts the f8-bishop in, while my queen is doing a job which a lesser piece could handle.” 2...Bd6: “I’ve developed a piece, but the d-pawn is obstructed, and my c8-bishop may be buried alive.” 2...d6: “Not bad, since it gives the c8-bishop an outlet. But wait – it limits the range of the f8-bishop, and again I’ve moved a pawn when I should be putting pieces to work.” 2...Nc6: “Eureka! This must be best, as I have developed a piece to its most suitable square and protected the e-pawn at the same time.” } 2... Nc6! { Without going into tedious analysis, Black picks out the best possible move. He follows the advice of the Frenchman who said, “Sortez les pièces!”. He brings a piece out and saves the e-pawn without any loss of time. I would caution you that this and other maxims are not to be blindly followed. In chess, as in life, rules must often be swept aside. In general, though, the principles governing sound chess play do make wonderful guideposts, especially in the opening, the middlegame and the ending! } 3. Bc4 { “The best attacking piece is the king’s bishop,” says Tarrasch, so White puts this piece to work and clears the way for early castling. The bishop seizes a valuable diagonal in the centre and attacks Black’s f7-pawn. This pawn is particularly vulnerable as it is guarded by one piece only – the king. It is not unusual, even early in the game, to sacrifice a piece for this pawn, so that the king in capturing it is uprooted, driven into the open and exposed to a violent attack. } 3... Bc5 { Is this the most suitable square for the bishop? Let us look at the alternatives: 3...Bb4: Inferior, because Black’s bishop takes no part in the struggle for control of the centre and has little scope here. 3...Bd6: Poor, since the d-pawn is blocked, and the other bishop may have trouble coming out. 3...Be7: Not too bad, because the bishop looks out on two diagonals and is well placed for defence. At e7 the bishop has made only one step forward, but it has been developed once it has left the back rank. The important thing to remember is that every piece must be put in motion. The strongest developing move is 3...Bc5. On this excellent square the bishop commands an important diagonal, exerts pressure on the centre and attacks a weak pawn. This deployment conforms to two golden rules for opening play: Place each piece as quickly as possible on the square where it is most effective. Move each piece only once in the opening. } 4. c3 { White’s primary object is to establish two pawns in the centre and with this move he intends to support an advance of the d-pawn. After 5 d4, attacking bishop and pawn, Black must reply 5...exd4. The recapture by 6 cxd4 leaves White with two pawns in control of the centre. His secondary aim is to bring the queen to b3, intensifying the pressure on the f7-pawn. These are its virtues, but there are drawbacks to 4 c3: In the opening, pieces not pawns should be moved. In advancing to c3, the pawn occupies a square that should be reserved for the b1-knight. } 4... Qe7 { Very good! Black develops a piece while parrying the threat. If White persists in playing 5 d4, the continuation 5...exd4 6 cxd4 Qxe4+ wins a pawn. The capture with check gives White no time to recover the pawn, and an extra pawn, everything else being equal, is enough to win the game. } 5. O-O { White postpones the advance of the d-pawn and moves his king to a safer place. Castle early in the game, preferably on the kingside. } (5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Qxe4+) 5... d6 { Strengthens the centre and supports the e-pawn and bishop. Now the c8-bishop can get into the game. } 6. d4 { With the hope that Black will exchange pawns. This would leave White with an impressive line-up in the centre, while the c3-square is then available for his knight. If now 6...exd4 7 cxd4 Qxe4, White punishes the pawn-snatching by 8 Re1 pinning the queen. } 6... Bb6 { But Black need not capture! Now that his e-pawn is secure, the bishop simply retreats, still bearing down on the white centre from its new position. Despite its formidable appearance, White’s pawn-centre is shaky. The d-pawn is attacked three times, and White must keep a triple guard on it while trying to complete his development. On 7 Qb3, which he contemplated earlier, the queen’s protection is removed, while on 7 Nbd2 it is cut off. Meanwhile White is faced with the threat of 7...Bg4 pinning and thereby rendering useless one of the pawn’s supports. Before committing himself to a definite course of action, White sets a little trap: } (6... exd4 7. cxd4 Qxe4 8. Re1) 7. a4 { A tricky move, but an illogical one. White threatens an attack on the bishop by 8 a5. If then 8....Bxa5, 9 d5 strikes at the knight protecting the bishop. After the reply 9...Nd8, White captures by 10 Rxa5, winning a piece. Should Black, after 8 a5, play 8...Nxa5, the continuation 9 Rxa5 Bxa5 10 Qa4+ nets White two pieces for a rook. But what right has White to play combinations when his development is so backward? An attack such as he initiates here is premature and should not succeed. Develop all your pieces before starting any combinations! } 7... a6 { Black prepares a retreat for his bishop. This does not violate the precept about making unnecessary pawn moves in the opening. Development is not meant to be routine or automatic; threats must always be countered first. If more justification is needed, consider that Black’s loss of time is compensated for by White’s fruitless 7 a4 move. } (7... h6 8. a5 Bxa5 (8... Nxa5 9. Rxa5 Bxa5 10. Qa4+) 9. d5 Nd8 10. Rxa5) 8. a5 { There is just a wee chance that Black will be tempted to take the pawn. } 8... Ba7 { But Black does not bite! } 9. h3 { A coffee-house move! Weak players make this move instinctively in dire dread of having a piece pinned. It is better to submit to the pin – a temporary inconvenience – than to prevent it by a move that loosens the position of the pawns defending the king and weakens the structure permanently. Playing h3 or g3 after castling creates an organic weakness that can never be remedied, as a pawn once advanced cannot retreat, and the position, once altered, cannot be restored. The pawn that has moved forward itself becomes a target for direct attack, while the square it guarded earlier (here it is g3) becomes a landing field for the enemy’s troops. “You should never, unless of necessity or to gain an advantage, move the pawns in front of the castled king,” says Tarrasch, “for each pawn move loosens the position.” Alekhine expresses it even more strongly: “Always try to keep the three pawns in front of your castled king on their original squares as long as possible.” Black can now speculate on breaking up White’s kingside by removing the h3-pawn, even at the cost of a piece. The recapture tears open the g-file and exposes White’s king to attack. This plan is of course not to be put into action until more pieces are brought into play. } 9... Nf6 { The knight swings into the fray with an attack on the e-pawn. The move is excellent and conforms with a useful general principle: Develop with a threat whenever possible! Remember that to meet the threat the opponent must drop whatever else he is doing. } 10. dxe5 { White exchanges, and opens up lines for his pieces. Unfortunately this reacts in Black’s favour, in accordance with the rule in these cases: Open lines are to the advantage of the player whose development is superior. } 10... Nxe5 { Much stronger than taking with the pawn. The knight on e5, beautifully centralized, radiates power in every direction (something a pawn cannot do). The disappearance of White’s d-pawn has benefited Black’s bishop, hidden away at a7. Its range has been extended, so that it now controls the whole of the long diagonal leading to White’s f2-pawn – and the king is just behind the pawn! What shall White do now? He has done nothing to relieve the plight of his e-pawn – it is still attacked by one of Black’s knights, while his bishop is threatened by the other. } 11. Nxe5 { This looks plausible, as White gets rid of a powerfully placed piece, but in making this exchange, White’s own f3-knight, the best defender of the castled position , also comes off the board. The importance of holding on to the knight in such situations was pointed out by Steinitz more than seventy years ago, when he said, “Three unmoved pawns on the kingside in conjunction with a minor piece form a strong bulwark against an attack on that wing.” Tarrasch attests to the valuable properties of the f3-knight with a simple emphatic statement: “A knight at f3 [f6 for Black] is the best defence of a castled position on the kingside.” } 11... Qxe5 { Observe that White’s knight has disappeared completely from the board, but Black’s knight has been replaced by another piece. This new piece, the queen, is magnificently posted at e5. She dominates the centre, bears down on the hapless e-pawn, and is poised for quick action on any part of the board. How does White solve the problems posed by the position of the menacing queen and the attacks on his e-pawn? He would love to dislodge the queen by 12 f4, but unfortunately the move is illegal. Can he save the pawn? } 12. Nd2 { Desperately hoping that Black will snatch up the pawn by 12...Nxe4, when there would follow 13 Nxe4 Qxe4 14 Rel, and the pin wins the queen. But Black is not interested in grabbing pawns. His positional superiority is great enough to justify looking for a combination that will conclusively force a win. His bishops exert terrific pressure on their respective diagonals (even though one bishop is still undeveloped!). Each of them attacks a pawn shielding the king. Black’s queen is ready to swing over to the kingside, while the knight can leap in if more help is needed. Black controls the centre, a condition that, Capablanca says, is essential for a successful attack against the king. In short, Black is entitled to a winning combination as reward for his methodical positional play. The question is: is there a target available for the explosion of this pent-up power? } 12... Bxh3! { Yes, indeed! The h-pawn, which innocently moved to h3 to prevent a pin! Black removes the offending pawn – fit punishment for the crime of weakening White’s position and betraying his king. } 13. gxh3 { White must capture the bishop or be a pawn down with nothing to show for it. } 13... Qg3+! { A crashing entrance! Notice how Black has exploited the two main defects of 9 h3. He captured the h-pawn itself and utilized the g3-square, weakened by its advance, as a point of invasion. } 14. Kh1 { White may not take the queen, as his f-pawn is pinned. } 14... Qxh3+ { Black destroys another defending pawn, further exposing the king. } 15. Kg1 { White’s only move. In return for the sacrificed bishop, Black has two pawns and the attack. } 15... Ng4 { Threatens mate on the move. White must guard against the threat at h2 or give his king a flight-square. If he tries to give his king room by 16Re1, he falls into 16...Bxf2#. Hence... } 16. Nf3 { To guard h2 and stop mate by the queen. How does Black conclude the attack? He reasons it out this way: I have captured two of the pawns near the king. If I can remove the third pawn it will deprive the king of the last shred of protection, and he will be helpless. This last defender, the f-pawn, is attacked by my knight and bishop, and protected by his rook and king. I must either drive off one of the defenders or attack the pawn a third time. Perhaps I can do both! } (16. Re1 Bxf2#) 16... Qg3+ { Again exploiting the circumstance that the f-pawn is pinned, Black attacks it with a third piece, the queen. } 17. Kh1 { The king must move to the corner and desert the pawn. Only the rook defends it now, against an attack by queen, knight and bishop. The pawn must fall, and with it the game. } 17... Bxf2 { Covers the king’s flight-square, g1, and prevents him from returning there in answer to a check. Black’s threat was 18...Qh3+ 19 Nh2 Qxh2#. As 18 Rxf2 runs into 18...Nxf2#, there was no escape. } 0-1

1. e4 { One of the best moves on the board! A pawn occupies the centre, and two pieces are freed for action. One hundred and fifty years ago the great Philidor said, “The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.” This advice is still good today. Only one other white first move, 1 d4, releases two pieces at the same time. } 1... e5 { “Probably the best reply,” says Capablanca. Black equalizes the pressure in the centre and frees his queen and a bishop. } 2. Nf3 { This is superior to such developing moves as 2 Nc3 or 2 Bc4, which are less energetic. The g1-knight comes into play with attack, which cuts down the choice of reply. Black must defend his pawn with 2...Nc6 or 2...d6 or he may decide to counterattack by 2...Nf6. Whatever his answer, he cannot dawdle. He must do something to meet White’s threat. } 2... Nc6 { Undoubtedly the logical move. The pawn is protected without loss of time and the b8-knight is developed to its best post in the opening in one move. } 3. Bc4 { Excellent, since the bishop seizes an important diagonal. The bishop strikes at f7, Black’s weakest point. A bishop is utilized to greatest effect either in controlling an important diagonal or in pinning (and rendering useless) an enemy piece. } 3... Bc5 { 3...Nf6 is a good alternative. Either move is in accord with the maxims of the masters, which they advocate and put to use: } { Get your pieces out fast!
Move each piece only once in the opening.
Develop with a view to control of the centre.
Move only those pawns that facilitate the development of pieces.
Move pieces, not pawns! } 4. c3 { White’s intentions are clear: he wants to support a pawn advance in the centre. His next move, 5 d4, will attack pawn and bishop. To save his e-pawn, Black will be forced to play 5...exd4. The recapture by 6 cxd4 will give White a strong formation of pawns in the centre. White’s idea has some point if it can be enforced. If the plan fails, his pawn standing at c3 deprives the b1-knight of its most useful square. } 4... Bb6! { Chess is not a game to be played mechanically. Usually, moving a piece twice in the opening is a waste of time, but threats must be parried before continuing development. The bishop retreats in order to pre-empt White’s contemplated 5 d4, which attacks pawn and bishop. } 5. d4 { Hoping to induce Black to exchange pawns. Note that Black’s e-pawn is attacked, but not his bishop. } 5... Qe7 { Instead of exchanging pawns (as he would have been compelled to do if his bishop were also under attack) Black defends his e-pawn while bringing another piece into play. His queen has advanced only one square, but even so the move is laudable: The act of leaving the back rank constitutes a developing move. In addition to developing a piece and defending a pawn, Black’s last move threatens to continue 6...exd4 7 cxd4 Qxe4+, winning a pawn. } 6. O-O { Besides the usual benefits derived from castling (safeguarding the king and mobilizing the rook) White’s move indirectly protects his e-pawn. If Black tries 6...exd4 7 cxd4 Qxe4, then 8 Re1 pins and wins the queen. } 6... Nf6! { The knight develops with a threat – attack on the e4-pawn. } 7. d5 { Tempting, as it will dislodge the c6-knight from its strong post. The move is natural, but to be censured on several counts: 1) The d-pawn blocks the path of White’s own c4-bishop, greatly limiting its action. 2) The range of Black’s b6-bishop has been increased; now its attack leads straight to White’s king. 3) White has moved a pawn while his queenside pieces are crying to be released. In the opening, move only those pawns that help develop the pieces. } 7... Nb8 { Retreat is safer than moving the knight to the side of the board. After 7...Na5 White’s response is 8 Bd3 after which he threatens to win the awkwardly placed knight by 9 b4. } (7... Na5 8. Bd3) 8. Bd3 { Defends the e-pawn, but the development of another piece is more consistent with opening strategy. Either 8 Nbd2 or 8 Qe2 protects the pawn while bringing one more piece into play. Do not move the same piece twice in the opening. It is interesting to see how Black punishes these infractions of principle. On the chessboard, if nowhere else, justice does triumph. } 8... d6 { No exception can be taken to this pawn move: it strengthens the centre, opens a path for the c8-bishop and relieves the queen of the burden of watching over the e-pawn. } 9. h3 { To prevent Black from pinning his knight by 9...Bg4, but as Publius Syrus observed some considerable time ago, “There are some remedies worse than the disease.” In disturbing the position of the pawns shielding his king, White weakens organically the structure of the kingside castled position and sets up the unfortunate h-pawn itself as a convenient target for direct attack. All chess theorists affirm the validity of the concept of leaving the kingside pawns unmoved, from Staunton, who said more than a hundred and forty years ago, “It is seldom prudent in an inexperienced player to advance the pawns on the side on which his king has castled,” to Reuben Fine, who said a century later, “The most essential consideration is that the king must not be subject to attack. He is safest when the three pawns are on their original squares.” How does Black take advantage of White’s last move? What is the best way to expose its imperfections? } 9... h6! { By playing a move similar to the one I have severely censured! What is the justification for Black’s advance of the h-pawn? Black has not weakened his defensive position, since his king is not castled on the kingside. His advance of the h-pawn is a gesture of attack, not a timid attempt to ward off a pin. The h-pawn will constitute a base for the g-pawn, which will march up to g5 and then g4. From there it will strike in two directions, at White’s knight and his h3-pawn. White will be compelled either to capture this pawn or let it capture his own h3-pawn. No matter which exchange occurs, it results in an opening up of the g-file, along which Black can align his pieces for an attack on the king. } 10. Qe2 { A developing move, but it may be too late. } 10... g5! { A bayonet thrust! The next step is to g4, where the pawn will break up White’s position. } 11. Nh2 { To prevent the intended advance. If the pawn moves on, it will be attacked three times and defended only twice. Has Black’s plan miscarried? } 11... g4! { Not at all! If necessary, Black will sacrifice a pawn for the sake of ripping away the defensive screen around White’s king. } 12. hxg4 { Practically forced, as Black was threatening 12...gxh3, as well as 12...g3. White has managed to close the file, for the time being. } 12... Rg8 { Now it is Black who attacks the g-pawn three times, while only two pieces defend it! Obviously, White may not give his pawn more support by 13 f3, as it’s against the law. It exposes his king to check. } 13. Bxh6 { Desperately snatching at a loose pawn. In view of his retarded development and the plight of his king, such a capture is risky policy. If any hope remains it lies in some such move as 13 Be3. Not only does this bring another piece into play, but also in opposing one force with another of equal strength, it neutralizes the pressure of Black’s bishop. The text-move disregards the admonition: Do not grab pawns at the expense of development or position. } 13... Nxg4 { Gaining time by threatening the bishop – among other things. Can White save the game? If he tries 14 Nxg4, Black forces the win by 14...Bxg4 (attacking the queen) 15 Qc2 Bf3 (threatening 16...Rxg2+ 17 Kh1 Qh4#) 16 g3 Qh4! and mate will come at h1. In this line of play, Black skilfully exploits the helplessness of White’s pinned pawns. } 14. Be3 { The bishop flees and attempts to repel one of the assailants. } (14. Nxg4 Bxg4 15. Qc2 Bf3) 14... Nxh2 { This capture greatly limits White’s choice of reply. The knight has taken a piece and now threatens the rook. } 15. Kxh2 { On the alternative 15 Bxb6 Black wins by 15...axb6 16 Kxh2 Qh4+ 17 Kg1 Rxg2+! (the fastest) 18 Kxg2 Bh3+! and White must either walk into mate by 19 Kg1 Qg5+ 20 Kh2 Qg2#, or into a discovered check by 19 Kh2 Bxfl+ 20 Kgl Bxe2, when the loss of material is ruinous. } (15. Bxb6 axb6 16. Kxh2 Qh4+ 17. Kg1 Rxg2+ 18. Kxg2 Bh3+ 19. Kg1 Qg5+ 20. Kh2 Qg2#) 15... Qh4+ { Black has two major pieces operating with full force on the two open files near the enemy king. The attack plays itself. } 16. Kg1 { White’s only move. } 16... Qh3 { Threatening mate on the move. There is no defence that will postpone the mate for long: If 17 g3, then Black continues 17...Rh8 18 f3 Bxe3+ 19 Qxe3 (or 19 Rf2 Qh1#) 19...Qxg3#. Or if 17 f3, guarding the g-pawn with his queen, then 17...Bxe3+ 18 Rf2 Qxg2# is mate. Strange that White, who feared the pin so much, should perish by the pin! } 0-1

1. d4 { Modern players consider this to be one of the best opening moves. It is equal in value to 1 e4 in that two pieces are freed for action, while a pawn seizes a central square. The difference is that the d-pawn stands protected whereas the e-pawn would be vulnerable to an early attack. } 1... d5 { This move and 1...Nf6 are by far the most common replies to 1 d4. White must not be allowed to play 2 e4 and dominate the vital central squares with his pawns. } 2. Nf3 { So great an authority as Emanuel Lasker, World Champion for 27 years, says of this move, “In my practice I have usually found it strongest to post the knights at B3, where they have a magnificent sway.” Here ‘B3’ refers to the squares c3 and f3 for White, or c6 and f6 for Black. } 2... Nf6 { Black follows suit in trumps, developing his king’s knight to its most useful square. } 3. e3 { Generally, it is dubious strategy to release one bishop while shutting in the other. In this game, White is adopting a system that calls for a storing up of dynamic energy behind the lines, which is released at the right time by an explosion at the key e4-square. To this end, White develops so that his pieces exert their maximum pressure at e4. His bishop will therefore occupy d3, and his b1-knight will move to d2. If more concentration of force is needed, his queen will supply it by developing at e2, or he may play O-O followed by Re1. Then, with all this potential energy ready to let loose, the e-pawn advances to e4, to rip the position apart and open fire on Black’s kingside. Development in the Colle System is on positional lines, but the objective is a kingside attack! } 3... e6 { This is a routine developing move which serves to maintain the symmetry but has the defect of not crossing White’s plans. Clearly, it was better strategy either to attack White’s pawn-centre by 3...c5 or to counter by 3...Bf5. Not only is this latter a simple, sound developing move, but also it prepares to oppose White’s bishop, which is headed for d3, with an equal force. The exchange of bishops, which follows sooner or later, will deprive White of a most valuable weapon in kingside attacks. } 4. Bd3 { Notice the difference! White’s bishop commands a beautiful (and undisputed) diagonal, while Black’s c8-bishop, covering squares of the same colour, is hemmed in by the e-pawn. } 4... c5! { Very good! Black strikes at the pawn formation in the centre and gives his queen access to the queenside. This freeing move of the c-pawn is of the greatest importance in queen’s pawn openings. } 5. c3 { “Move only one or two pawns in the opening!” say all the authorities, but no principle must be followed uncompromisingly. This move permits White to meet the advance ...c4 by Bc2, keeping the bishop lined up against Black’s kingside. In the event that pawns are exchanged on d4, White can recapture with the e-pawn and free his c1-bishop. } 5... Nc6 { Another good move. The knight comes into play toward the centre, increasing the pressure on the d-pawn. } 6. Nbd2 { An odd-looking sortie. Not only does this knight block the paths of the queen and a bishop, but also the piece itself seems to be doing little good. Yet, an expert would make this move without a moment’s hesitation! For one thing, the knight adds its weight to the pressure on the strategically important e4-square, the springboard of the coming attack. For another, it is mobilized once it gets off the back rank. Finally, it can hop out of the way of the queen and the bishop when it is expedient for it to do so. } 6... Be7 { Black brings another piece into play (remember that the bishop is doing a job once it leaves the back rank) and prepares to get his king into safety by castling. } 7. O-O { The king flees to a less exposed sector, while the rook comes out of hiding. } 7... c4 { This is the sort of move instinctively made by a beginner. Its purpose is to chase off an annoying piece from its favourable post. The move is weak because it releases the pressure on White’s centre. Tension must be maintained if Black is to have something to say about affairs in this vital area. Counterplay in the centre is the best means of opposing a kingside attack and to secure counterplay, the pawn position must be kept fluid. } 8. Bc2 { Naturally the bishop retreats, but stays on the diagonal leading to the e4-square, where the break will come. } 8... b5 { Primarily to make room at b7 for his light-squared bishop, but also with an eye to making trouble with a possible advance of his queenside pawns. } 9. e4! { The key move in this opening! It will open up lines for an attack by White’s pent-up pieces. } 9... dxe4 { Not an attractive choice for Black, but he cannot have the threat of the e5 advance (displacing his knight and severely cramping his movements) perpetually hanging over his head. } 10. Nxe4 { With this recapture, White’s pieces that were crouched in the background spring into play. White has the initiative and a commanding position in which to exercise it. If no immediate attacking opportunities present themselves, he can quietly put on more pressure by Qe2, Re1, Bf4 (or Bg5) and Rad1, and wait for Black’s game to crack. } 10... O-O { It might have been wiser to postpone castling (contrary to usual principles) as White is poised for an attack in that direction. This is another case where the value of a precept is conditioned by circumstances. Black would do better to try for counterplay by 10...Qc7 followed by 11...Bb7 and 12...Rd8. } 11. Qe2 { This developing move also threatens to win a piece. The idea is 12 Nxf6+ Bxf6 13 Qe4, and the threat of mate on the kingside wins the exposed knight on the queenside. } 11... Bb7 { Black guards his knight while developing another piece. } 12. Nfg5! { Threatening the deadly 13 Nxf6+ Bxf6 14 Bxh7+ Kh8 15 Qh5. Why an exclamation mark for a simple threat which is so easily countered? Why glorify this move when Black can not only save the pawn but also cause White to lose time? Black simply moves the h-pawn one square, rescues the pawn, and forces White’s knight to retreat. The answer to these questions is that White’s purpose with his brilliant knight move is to compel one of the pawns defending the king to step forward. The secret of conducting a successful kingside attack is to create a breach in the cordon of pawns surrounding the enemy king; to induce or force one of the pawns to move. The change in the line-up of pawns fixes the defence with a permanent weakness. } 12... h6 { “Touch the pawns before your king with only infinite delicacy,” says Santasiere. But, alas, it’s too late – Black must disturb the pawn position. Had he tried 12...Nxe4, the recapture by 13 Qxe4 threatens mate, and compels 13...g6 – and the pawns are disarranged! } 13. Nxf6+ { Destroying the f6-knight, the best defender of a castled position. } 13... Bxf6 { The alternative 13...gxf6 loses quickly. White could win either by gobbling up pawns with 14 Nxe6 fxe6 15 Qg4+ Kh8 (15...Kf7 16 Qg6#) 16 Qg6 f5 17 Qxh6+ Kg8 18 Qxe6+ and the f-pawn falls next, or with 14 Nh3 (threatening 15 Bxh6) 14...Kg7 15 Bxh6+ Kxh6 16 Qe3+ Kg7 17 Qg3+ Kh8 18 Qh4+ followed by 19 Qh7#. } (13... gxf6 14. Nxe6 fxe6 15. Qg4+ Kh8 16. Qg6 f5 17. Qxh6+ Kg8 18. Qxe6+) 14. Qe4 { Threatening instant mate. } 14... g6 { Making room for the king’s escape by 14...Re8 does not look inviting, as after 15 Qh7+ Kf8 16 Ne4 White’s attack appears dangerous. However, it is preferable to Black’s actual move, which stops the queen coming any closer, but alters the pawn configuration. This change in the pawn formation saddles Black with a weakness that is organic, and one that can turn out to be fatal. All this is encouraging to White, but how does he proceed? How does he exploit the weaknesses in Black’s position? Above all, what does he do about his knight which is still under attack? Shall it retreat abjectly? Before moving the knight back to f3 mechanically and unthinkingly, White looks carefully at the situation. The opportunity to strike a decisive blow may be here at this very moment, but one hasty ‘obvious move’ may give Black just enough breathing time to reorganize his defences. This is the position, and here is how White reasons out his attack: The key point must be Black’s g-pawn, which guards his king from invasion. If anything happens to this pawn – if it is captured – the defence crumbles, and I can break into the fortress. How do I go about removing it from the board? The g-pawn is protected by the f-pawn; suppose I destroy its support by sacrificing my knight for the f-pawn? After 15 Nxf7 Kxf7 (or 15...Rxf7) 16 Qxg6+, and I have two pawns for my knight, with a third one in sight, as the h-pawn must fall. Material is then approximately even, but his position is completely broken up, and clinching the win should be easy. This might be the general plan, but before putting it in motion, White analyses the combination for possible flaws and comes up with this: after 15 Nxf7 Rxf7 (bringing another piece to the defence) 16 Qxg6+ Rg7 17 Qxh6 Nxd4!, suddenly Black is the aggressor! He threatens mate in two by 18...Ne2+ 19 Khl Bxg2#, as well as outright ruin by 18...Rxg2+, followed by a deadly discovered check. Clearly this line of play is too dangerous. Is there another way to break through, without letting Black’s rook come into the game? Can I get rid of the f-pawn without disturbing the rook? It is important that I remove this pawn, as it supports the g-pawn and the e-pawn. Wait a minute! There is a clue in the last sentence. The f-pawn, guarding two other pawns, is serving two masters. Obviously it is overworked! I must add to its burden by luring it away from its present important post! Therefore: } 15. Nxe6! { The knight captures a pawn and attacks queen and rook. } (15. Nxf7 Rxf7 16. Qxg6+ Rg7 17. Qxh6 Nxd4) 15... fxe6 { Black must accept the sacrifice or lose rook and pawn for the knight. } 16. Qxg6+ { Stronger than taking the e-pawn, after which Black has four ways to get out of check. Each of these replies might lose, but it is more practical to attack the enemy with blows that leave him little choice of reply. } 16... Bg7 { The only move, since 16...Kh8 walks right into mate. } 17. Qh7+ { White has other attractive continuations in 17 Bxh6 or 17 Qxe6+, but this forces the king out into the open where White’s other pieces can get at him. } 17... Kf7 { The only move. } 18. Bg6+ { Stronger than 18 Bxh6, to which Black retorts 18...Qf6 followed by 19...Rh8. The text-move keeps him on the run. } 18... Kf6 { Certainly not 18...Ke7, when 19 Qxg7+ lets White pick up a couple of bishops. } 19. Bh5 { White is still angling for 20 Qg6+ Ke7 21 Qxg7+, when both black bishops come off the board. } 19... Ne7 { The only way to prevent the queen check. } 20. Bxh6 { White is not playing to pick up stray pawns, but to bring another piece into the attack. The pawn that is added to the collection is incidental to the general scheme of things. } 20... Rg8 { To parry the threat of 21 Qxg7+ Kf5 22 Qe5#. On 20...Bxh6 White intended 21 Qxh6+ Kf5 22 Rael, when the threat of mate either by the rook or the g-pawn is decisive. } (20... Bxh6 21. Qxh6+ Kf5 22. Rae1) 21. h4 { The new threat is 22 Bg5#. } 21... Bxh6 { Loses on the spot, but there was no defence for Black: if 21...e5, then 22 Bxg7+ Rxg7 23 dxe5+ and the king must abandon the rook. } (21... e5 22. Bxg7+ Rxg7 23. dxe5+) 22. Qf7# { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0

1. e4 { Values were constant in many fields of endeavour at the time this game was played: Stories began, “Once upon a time,” Tic-tac-toe players put a cross in the central square, Checker masters started with 11-15, Chess masters opened with 1 e4. Despite the researches of the scientists, these remain good beginnings. } 1... e5 { Black opens lines for two of his pieces and establishes equilibrium in the centre. } 2. f4 { An offer of a pawn to induce Black to surrender his share of the centre. Accepting the gift enables White to continue with 3 Nf3, followed by 4 d4, and dominate the centre with his pawns. In addition, the opening of the f-file will offer White the opportunity of directing his attack at the vulnerable point f7. This is a tender spot whether Black’s king stays at home or castles. } 2... Bc5 { Probably the safest way to decline the gambit: 1) The bishop bears down on the centre and controls an excellent diagonal. 2) The bishop supplements the pawn’s attack on d4 and prevents White from moving his d-pawn to d4. 3) The bishop’s presence at c5, overlooking gl, forbids White from castling in a hurry. } 3. Nc3 { White avoids 3 fxe5 because the reply (coming like a shot, probably) 3...Qh4+ 4 g3 (even worse is 4 Ke2 Qxe4#) 4...Qxe4+ wins a rook for Black. White’s actual move is not as energetic as 3 Nf3, but in playing 3 Nc3 Blackburne was trying to lure his opponent into playing 3....Bxgl 4 Rxgl Qh4+ 5 g3 Qxh2, when 6 Rg2 followed by 7 fxe5 gives White a fine game. } (3. fxe5 Qh4+ 4. g3 (4. Ke2 Qxe4#) 4... Qxe4+) 3... Nc6 { A simple retort to the dubious invitation. Black continues mustering his forces on the field of action. In the fight for control of the centre, his knight does its share by exerting pressure on the squares e5 and d4. } (3... Bxg1 4. Rxg1 Qh4+ 5. g3 Qxh2 6. Rg2) 4. Nf3 { Did White miss a chance to win material by 4 fxe5 Nxe5 5 d4? No, because 4 fxe5 is met by 4...d6, whereby Black offers a pawn for the sake of securing a free, easy development. The text-move puts an end to the possibility of being bothered by a queen check and revives the threat of winning the e-pawn. } 4... exf4 { This is a poor move on at least four counts: 1) In moving a pawn instead of a piece, Black loses sight of the chief objective in all opening strategy: Move the pieces! Get them off the back rank and on the job! 2) He surrenders his hold on the centre and the privileges it confers. 3) He wastes time capturing a pawn which he cannot retain. 4) He permits White to seize the centre next move, which forces a retreat by his bishop and a consequent loss of time. Tarrasch considered a move such as the one just made by Black a worse offence than an outright blunder, such as leaving a piece en prise. Instead of this, Black might better have played 4...d6, which holds everything and lets the c8-bishop see daylight. } 5. d4! { Of course! No player should take more than half a second to see the power of this pawn push! The pawn seizes control of a good bit of the centre (occupying d4 and attacking two other important squares), dislodges the bishop from its strong position, and uncovers an attack by his own c1-bishop on the f4-pawn. } 5... Bb4 { It would have been sounder strategy to retreat to e7 instead, where the bishop is invaluable for defence. } 6. Bxf4 { White gains a tempo with this capture, as he recovers the lost pawn and develops a piece at the same time. } 6... d5 { Black attacks the white e-pawn, disputing possession of the centre. Meanwhile, Black gives his queenside pieces more air. } 7. e5 { All pawn moves have positive and negative aspects. (Tarrasch used to say, “Every pawn move loosens the position”) One drawback for White in the advance of his e-pawn is that the occupation of e5 by a pawn deprives his pieces of a useful square. The knight especially operates to great advantage when posted at e5. In compensation, the pawn exercises a cramping effect on Black’s entire position and imposes particular restraint on Black’s king’s knight, which cannot develop naturally at f6. } 7... Bxc3+ { Black is intrigued by the prospect of saddling Blackburne with a doubled pawn, but why capture a piece that is pinned and can do no harm? Why relax the pressure at all? A more commendable procedure was to bring up the reserves, starting with 7...Bf5. } 8. bxc3 { In return for the handicap of the doubled pawns (little enough, since the advance c4 forces an exchange and undoubles the pawns) White enjoys advantages in his two bishops and in the open b-file which his rook will put to good use. } 8... Be6 { A superficial move, as the bishop could develop to greater effect at f5. There it would hinder White from freely posting his bishop at d3, except at the cost of permitting the bishops to be exchanged. Developing the pieces to squares where they are most effective assures an advantage; preventing the opponent from doing likewise increases it. It is important to fight for control of the vital squares. } 9. Bd3 { Clearly an excellent deployment: the bishop reaches out in two directions, ready to take a hand on either side of the board. } 9... h6 { Apparently to prevent 10 Ng5 or 10 Bg5. White, who is interested only in completing his development, has not the slightest intention of making either of these moves. The move ...h6 by Black (or h3 by White) should be played only if the h-pawn is to form a base for an attack by pawns, i.e. if it supports an advance by the g-pawn. Defensively, the move does more harm than good, as it loosens the pawn structure and weakens its resistance to attack. It is especially dangerous if the king has castled on the kingside, as the pawn itself, standing out from the ranks, provides a convenient target. Also (as if the foregoing were not enough) it does nothing to further the cause of development and wastes time which should be devoted to the liberation of pieces which are still shut in. } 10. O-O { At one stroke White secures the safety of his king and brings his rook on to an open file. It is true that the file is cluttered up by a knight and bishop, which interfere with the rook’s influence, but they are pieces, not pawns, and can move quickly out of the way. } 10... Nge7 { Not the happiest spot for the knight, but how else can it get into the game? Poor as this development is, it is by far preferable to letting the knight stay uselessly at home. } 11. Rb1! { The master makes this move in a flash, while the run-of-the-mill player never even looks at it! What is the rook’s future on this file? It attacks a pawn, but the pawn is easily protected. Why not try for a kingside attack, instead of this futile demonstration? The answer lies in this: the master’s instinct (or perhaps his knowledge or experience) tells him that he must seize any files that are open – control them at once with his rooks or his queen. “Make the moves,” it says, “that conform with the requirements of the position, and you will be suitably rewarded. Play the moves necessary to establish a superior position! Develop your pieces so that they enjoy maximum mobility, and control most of the territory. Direct your efforts to weakening the enemy position, cramping the movements of his pieces, and reducing the capacity of his resistance before you make the first move of a combination. When the time is ripe, the attack will play itself. The decisive combination will stare you in the face.” } 11... b6 { This too is a move that distinguishes the master from the amateur! How easy it is to advance the pawn, safeguard it from attack, and let the rook bite on granite! Obvious as this defence is, no top-ranking player would rush to adopt it! He would try to avoid disturbing the pawn formation and consider instead such alternatives as 11...Rb8 or 11...Qc8. After the actual move, the light squares on Black’s queenside have been weakened. More to the point, the advance of the pawn deprives the c6-knight of solid support – a circumstance that White will exploit in his forthcoming attack on the king, away over at the other side of the board. } 12. Qd2 { The queen leaves the first rank to enable the rooks to get in touch with each other. They may wish to increase the pressure on an open file by doubling on it, or otherwise work in concert. The full meaning of White’s queen move might easily be overlooked by an opponent who makes plausible but superficial replies. Chess must not be played mechanically, even in the simplest, most placid positions. } 12... O-O { Walking right into the teeth of the storm! Before making a move that suggests itself so readily, Black might have asked himself, “How can I exploit White’s one weakness, the doubled pawns on the c-file?” He might then have hit upon 12...Na5, with the object of swinging the knight to c4. There it blockades the doubled pawn, interferes with the free movement of White’s pieces, and in general sticks like a bone in the throat. White could capture the knight, but then he parts with one of his valuable bishops, and as a result of the exchange his pawn position would be inferior to Black’s. Finally, Black could then anchor one of his pieces to great effect on d5, a square from which it could never be evicted by pawns. } 13. Bxh6 { Blackburne must have snatched this pawn up at lightning speed! At the price of a bishop, he immediately gets two pawns as material return, demolishes the barricade of pawns near the king – and more, as we shall see. } 13... gxh6 { Black must capture the bishop, or be a pawn down without any positional compensation. } 14. Qxh6 { Let us see what White’s return is for the piece that he sacrificed: 1) He has two pawns in tangible assets. 2) His queen is powerfully placed in enemy territory – threatening mate on the move, in fact! 3) He has ripped away the screen of pawns that sheltered Black’s king. 4) He has a strong attack in prospect, starting with 15 Ng5. 5) If more help is needed, he can call up the reserves (after 15 Ng5) by 16 Rf3, followed by 17 Rg3. } 14... Ng6 { Was there any other defence? 1) 14...Nf5 (to interfere with the action of the bishop), then 15 Bxf5 Bxf5 16 Qxc6 picks up the unprotected knight on the queenside, a consequence of Black’s instinctive advance of his b-pawn at his eleventh move. 2) 14...Bf5 15 Bxf5 Nxf5 16 Qxc6, and again White scoops up the unfortunate knight. 3) 14...f5 leaves Black’s bishop en prise. White would capture it following Tartakower’s excellent advice: “Take it first and philosophize afterward!” } (14... Nf5 15. Bxf5 Bxf5 16. Qxc6) 15. Ng5 { Again threatening mate at h7. This is speedier than the brutal alternative 15 Bxg6 fxg6 16 Qxg6+ followed by 17 Qxe6, which wins material, and eventually the game. Blackburne heeds the injunction laid down by Baron von Heydebrand und der Lasa, who flourished in the nineteenth century: “The simplest and the shortest way of winning is the best way.” } (15. Bxg6 fxg6 16. Qxg6+) 15... Re8 { The rook provides the king with a flight square. } 16. Rxf7 { Again there is a pleasant choice of winning methods: two others are 16 Bxg6 and if 16...fxg6, then 17 Qh7#; and 16 Nh7, followed by 17 Nf6+ and a quick mate. The move actually made nails down the king and renews the threat of mate on the move. } (16. Bxg6 fxg6 17. Qh7#) (16. Nh7) 16... Bxf7 { Forced, if Black wants to avoid resigning. } 17. Qh7+ { Nudging the king into a fatal situation. } 17... Kf8 { The only move. The danger in playing plausible but perfunctory chess is finely illustrated in this game. Blackburne, who played this and seven other games simultaneously while blindfolded, relied on order and method to achieve victory. It proved easily superior to the move-to-move groping of his sighted opponent. } 18. Qxf7# { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0

1. e4 { The most important target in the opening is to develop the pieces as fast as possible in order to occupy and control the centre. White’s first move fixes a pawn in the centre and, as the first step in getting his pieces off the back rank, opens avenues for his queen and bishop. } 1... e5 { Black equalizes the pressure in the centre and releases two pieces for action. He must be content with this, as he cannot hope at this early stage to wrest the initiative away from White by force. } 2. Nf3 { It is good strategy to make developing moves that embody threats, as it cuts down the choice of reply. Against the passive 2 Nc3, which develops a piece but attacks nothing, Black can choose from among such good responses as 2...Nf6, 2...Nc6 and 2...Bc5. Likewise, if White’s second move is the quiet 2 Bc4, Black has three good options in 2...Nf6, 2...Bc5 and 2...c6 (with a view to an early ...d5). } 2... Nc6 { Black saves his e-pawn and develops a piece. The knight comes into play efficiently: its action is directed toward influencing the centre. It defends the e5-pawn and attacks d4. } 3. Bc4 { The bishop comes out, taking up a post where it commands a diagonal leading towards Black’s king. It attacks a pawn which is peculiarly vulnerable as it is defended only by the king. This does not mean that White will capture the pawn in the next few moves, but the threat is always there. Many a short brilliancy owes its life to similar captures in which the bishop is sacrificed simply to draw the king out into the open where White’s other pieces can get at him. } 3... Bc5 { Black follows suit, bringing his bishop out to the most suitable square. In the opening, a bishop is best placed for attack when it controls a diagonal passing through the centre or when it pins a hostile knight and renders it immobile. Defensively, the bishop would do a fine job at e7, where it radiates power in several directions, making an intrusion by an enemy piece difficult. } 4. c3 { Supporting an advance of the d-pawn with a view to controlling the centre. White postpones castling as his king is in no danger. } 4... Nf6 { A powerful counter to the threat: Black develops a piece and attacks a pawn. } 5. d4 { White meets this by attacking a piece. } 5... exd4 { Practically forced, since 5...Bd6 guarding the e-pawn is clumsy, since it blocks the d-pawn, while 5...Bb6 permits 6 dxe5 Nxe4 7 Bxf7+ Kxf7 8 Qd5+ and White regains his piece, remaining a pawn ahead. White could also play 7 Qd5, attacking the knight while threatening mate, instead of 7 Bxf7+. } (5... Bb6 6. dxe5 Nxe5 7. Bxf7+ (7. Qd5) 7... Kxf7 8. Qd5+) 6. cxd4 { White’s array of pawns looks impressive, but can the centre be maintained? } 6... Bb4+ { Far superior to the timid 6...Bb6 after which Black is crushed somewhat like this: 7 d5 Nb8 8 e5 Ng8 (both knights return home ingloriously) 9 O-O Ne7 10 d6 Ng6 11 Ng5 O-O (Black’s king is protected by three pawns and the knight; in four moves the knight and one pawn disappear, while the remaining two pawns are pinned and helpless) 12 Qh5 (threatening 13 Qxh7#) 12...h6 13 Qxg6 (again threatening mate – the white queen is of course taboo) 13...hxg5 14 Bxg5 Qe8 15 Bf6 (D) and White, exploiting two pins, forces mate within two moves. This is the final position of this line: After the actual move, White must get his king out of check, and if possible save the threatened pawn. } (6... Bb6 7. d5 Nb8 8. e5 Ng8 9. O-O Ne7 10. d6 Ng6 11. Ng5 O-O 12. Qh5 h6 13. Qxg6 hxg5 14. Bxg5 Qe8 15. Bf6) 7. Nc3 { White prefers this, which offers a pawn, to 7 Bd2 Bxd2+ 8 Nbxd2, when the e-pawn is protected. } (7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2) 7... O-O { “Chess is not for timid souls,” wrote Steinitz in a letter to Bachmann. Castling early in the game is generally sound strategy. In this case it is inappropriate, as White’s centre is formidable and must be destroyed. Black must play 7...Nxe4, accepting the offer of a pawn, and take his chances of surviving whatever attack might follow. It cannot be worse than this passive castling, which results in both his knights being evicted from their fine posts. Pillsbury gave as his rule, which he said was absolute and vital: “Castle because you want to or because you must, but not because you can.” } (7... Nxe4) 8. d5 { Ordinarily, such moves are suspect, as d5 should be occupied by a piece, but here the pawn dislodges the knight and prevents Black forever from freeing his game by ...d5. } 8... Ne7 { As good as there is. The shift to a5 is countered by 9 Bd3, and the knight is stranded at the side of the board. } (8... Na5 9. Bd3) 9. e5 { Now a shot at the other knight! } 9... Ne4 { Retreating to e8 does not look attractive, so Black plays to exchange knights. } 10. Qc2 { Protects his own knight, which was twice attacked, and threatens the enemy’s. } 10... Nxc3 { Practically forced, as defending the knight by 10...f5 allows 11 d6+ and the other knight falls. } (10... f5 11. d6+) 11. bxc3 { This recapture gains a tempo: Black’s bishop must lose a move retreating, while White’s advantages multiply. Now he enjoys an open b-file for his rook and an extra diagonal for his dark-squared bishop. } 11... Bc5 { Naturally, this offers better chances than moving to a5, the only other flight square. A comparison of the two sides’ positions shows that White’s is decidedly superior. He has more pieces in play, and they have far more mobility than Black’s. He also has better prospects of bringing more pieces into the battle. The recommended recipe now is to occupy Black with threats – keep him on the run and give him no time to put up effective resistance. } 12. Ng5! { Ostensibly to scare Black by the threat of mate; actually, the purpose is to induce a weakening advance of one of the king’s retinue of pawns. If one of these pawns does move, Black is done for! For example, 12...f5 13 d6+ wins a piece, or if 12...g6, then 13 Ne4 forces 13...Bb6, when 14 Bh6 drives the rook to e8, and 15 Nf6+ wins the exchange. } 12... Ng6 { The only defence! The kingside pawns remain intact, but Black has been compelled to place his pieces where White wants them. Under such circumstances the chances of Black putting up a good fight are not too bright. White must avoid Black’s error of castling as a matter of routine development. Such a quiet course would give Black time to play 13...d6 or 13...h6, beating the knight back. White must not give his opponent a moment to catch his breath. He must attack, attack, attack! } (12... f5 13. d6+) (12... g6 13. Ne4 Bb6 14. Bh6 Re8 15. Nf6+) 13. h4 { Threatening to move on to h5, dislodging the knight, and then mate with the queen. } 13... h6 { What else is there? Black tries to drive off the menacing knight. He cannot do this by 13...f6 as 14 d6+ Kh8 15 Nf7+ wins the exchange. } (13... f6 14. d6+ Kh8 15. Nf7+) 14. d6! { A powerful stroke! Black’s bishop is cut off from the defence, while a line is opened for White’s bishop. White now threatens 15 Qxg6, as the pinned f-pawn could not capture the queen. } 14... hxg5 { Black might as well take whatever material he can. } 15. hxg5! { The knight will not run away (the penalty being 16 Qh7#). Meanwhile, the rook has a lovely open file, and the queen still threatens to capture the knight. } 15... Re8 { The king needs more room! } 16. Qxg6 { Regaining the piece without relaxing the pressure. White threatens one mate in one, and two mates in two. } 16... Rxe5+ { Black consoles himself by equalizing the material and gives one despairing check before he yields. } 17. Kf1 { Simplest, as the mate threats are still on tap. There was little chance that White would blunder by 17 Kd2 Qxg5+ 18 Qxg5 Rxg5, when all the good work has gone for naught. Black can avoid mate on the move by 17...Qe8 (incidentally threatening mate himself!), only to fall into 18 Qh7+ Kf8 19 Qh8#. } (17. Kd2 Qxg5+ 18. Qxg5 Rxg5) 17... Qe8 18. Qh7+ Kf8 19. Qh8# 1-0

1. e4 { “Always deploy,” says Franklin K. Young, “so that the right oblique may be readily established in case the objective plane remains open or becomes permanently located on the centre or on the king’s wing, or that the crochet aligned may readily be established if the objective plane becomes permanently located otherwise than at the extremity of the strategic front.” If this is somewhat obscure (and I see no reason to believe otherwise) the conclusion it reaches is stated in limpid prose by the same writer: “The best initial move for White is 1 e4”. } 1... e5 { Black’s best chance to equalize is to get a fair share of the most important squares – those in the centre. With l...e5 he stakes out his claim, meanwhile freeing two of his pieces. } 2. Nf3 { You may play this confidently, secure in the knowledge that no master alive can make a better move. } 2... Nc6 { A commendable reply: Black develops a piece, protecting his pawn at the same time. } 3. Bb5 { Probably the strongest move on the board. The bishop puts a restraining hand on the pawn’s defender. There is no immediate threat of winning the pawn as after 4 Bxc6 dxc6 5 Nxe5, the reply 5...Qd4 regains the pawn. But there is pressure on the knight, and this pressure becomes intensified when Black sooner or later advances his d-pawn since the knight is then pinned. } 3... f5 { A bold attempt to seize the initiative. The idea is to lure White into surrendering the centre by taking the f-pawn. } 4. d4 { An aggressive player would like White’s counterattack on the e-pawn. Another dynamic line is 4 Nc3, aiming for piece-play, while a conservative player might be content with 4 d3, supporting the e-pawn so that in the event of an exchange on e4 he would retain a pawn in the centre. } 4... fxe4 { Black’s capture is intended mainly to evict the knight from its strong post. } 5. Nxe5 { Apparently a strong move. White gets his pawn back and prevents 5...d6 or 5...d5. After either of these moves, the continuation 6 Nxc6 bxc6 7 Bxc6+ wins the exchange. White also has a powerful threat in 6 Bxc6 dxc6 7 Qh5+ Ke7 8 Qf7+ Kd6 9 Nc4#. This is all very tempting, since the possibility of mating so early in the game is attractive to the young player, but such ambition should be suppressed. Premature mating attacks are usually repulsed with loss of time or material to the aggressor. A safer continuation is 5 Bxc6 dxc6 6 Nxe5. } (5. Bxc6 dxc6 6. Nxe5) 5... Nxe5 { Black removes the best defender of White’s kingside position and puts an end to any combinative notions White might have entertained. } 6. dxe5 { White has nothing to show for the over-energetic move 4 d4. The simple and natural development of the b1-knight by 4 Nc3 would have been preferable. } 6... c6! { A pawn move when pieces should be brought into play? Yes, if the move is justified by the particular position. Black has four good arguments for the pawn push: 1) He must drive off the bishop before he can advance his d-pawn (otherwise the king is in check). 2) The time lost in moving the pawn is compensated for by the fact that the bishop must also lose a move in retreating. 3) He opens a fine diagonal for his queen. 4) The attack on the bishop will win a pawn, and “A pawn is worth a little trouble,” according to Steinitz. } 7. Bc4 { Ordinarily, this is an excellent place for the bishop, but e2 is more consistent with the requirements of the position. White has lost the services of his king’s knight, and the bishop might help the defence of the kingside. } 7... Qa5+ { Double attack on king and e5-pawn. } 8. Nc3 { The best way to get out of check. White places the b1-knight where it belongs in the opening. } 8... Qxe5 { Black has won a pawn, which is a good start toward winning the game. His aim now is to get an attack rolling in the direction of White’s denuded kingside. } 9. O-O { Plausible – and bad! It was more discreet to conceal his intentions, develop the queenside pieces, and castle later, perhaps on the queenside. } 9... d5! { Of course! Black seizes the centre, chases off the enemy bishop, and enables his own c8-bishop to make an appearance. All this in one move! } 10. Bb3 { Here too the defensive move 10 Be2, placing the bishop where he overlooks two diagonals, is preferable. } 10... Nf6 { Organizing a kingside attack by a simple process – developing his pieces! } 11. Be3 { Partly to prevent Black from playing 11...Bc5, partly to dislodge the centralized queen by 12 Bd4 or 12 Qd4. } 11... Bd6! { This fine move has more significance than the mere development of a piece combined with a mating threat. The ulterior object is to create a permanent irremediable weakness in White’s kingside position by forcing one of the defending pawns to make a move. } 12. g3 { The only possible defence. If instead 12 f4, then 12...exf3 13 Qxf3 Qxh2+ 14 Kf2 Bg4 and Black wins. After the text move, Black starts an attack, but using his pieces rather than trying to break into the position by the pawn assault 12...h5 followed by ...h4. } (12. f4 exf3 13. Qxf3 Qxh2+ 14. Kf2 Bg4) 12... Bg4 { Black bases his attack on the theme of penetration. White has weakened the f3- and h3-squares by 12 g3, as these squares are no longer guarded by the g-pawn. These squares are now ‘holes’, as Steinitz first named them. Enemy pieces that settle themselves on these squares stand firm, as no pawns can ever drive them away. The bishop attacks the queen, with the object of insinuating itself into f3 without loss of time. } 13. Qd2 { As good as there is. If White interposes the knight at e2 instead, then 13...Qh5, attacking the knight once more, forces 14 Re1, whereupon 14...Qh3 plants a piece in one hole. Black’s following move is 15...Bf3, occupying the other hole, and the stage is set for mate at g2. } 13... Bf3 { The second step in the process of penetration. } 14. Bf4 { Hoping for a line such as 14...Qe7 15 Bxd6 Qxd6 16 Qf4, when an exchange or two might ease his difficulties. After White’s fourteenth move, Black has a forced mate in a few moves. } 14... Qf5! { Deserts the bishop, but Black is interested only in getting the queen to h3, with a death grip on the light squares. } (14... Qe7 15. Bxd6 Qxd6 16. Qf4) 15. Nd1 { The only possible chance to defend. The knight is to be brought to e3 to guard the g2-square, where mate impends. } 15... Qh3 { Threatening instant mate. } 16. Ne3 { Defending the critical square. } 16... Ng4 { The new threat is mate at h2. Notice the clever use of the weakened light squares on the kingside as the black pieces infiltrate the enemy position. } 17. Rfc1 { Room for the king! } 17... Qxh2+ { And mate comes next move. } 0-1

1. e4 { This move accomplishes a great deal: } 1... e6 { With several objects in view: One, to prevent White from dictating the opening. After the conventional reply 1...e5 White can play the Ruy Lopez, the Giuoco Piano, the Scotch, the Vienna Game or a dangerous gambit of some sort. Another is that Black’s cramped position may tempt White into a disastrous premature attack. A third is that the pawn at e6 supports an advance by 2...d5, an attack on the e-pawn which might wrest the initiative. The French Defence is not to be underestimated. It conceals a great deal of dynamic energy behind a modest facade. } 2. d4 { If it’s worthwhile to establish one pawn in the centre, then keeping two pawns there should double the benefits. } 2... d5 { Black gives his queen more scope and challenges the centre. } 3. Nc3 { Clearly an excellent response, as the knight develops to its proper square, protects the e-pawn, and bears down on d5. } 3... Nf6 { Black in turn brings his own knight to its strongest position with gain of time – a further attack on the e4-pawn. } 4. exd5 { Many players prefer to add to the pressure by 4 Bg5 (which develops a piece and renders one of the enemy’s impotent) rather than exchange pawns, which relaxes the tension. Spielmann, who likes wide-open positions, clears away a couple of pawns to give his pieces more room for their activities. Which move is better? Which should you play? The answer is: play the move that you like, the one that best suits your style and temperament. If you are a careful, cautious player who knows the full value of a pawn – that each one is a potential queen, and that the loss of a pawn may be the loss of the game – stick to 4 Bg5 and the openings of positional chess, the Ruy Lopez, the Queen’s Pawn openings, the Réti and the English. On the other hand, if you prefer daring, adventurous chess, and a pawn is simply a barrier to the sweeping onrush of an attack by your pieces, play openings which allow scope for your imagination, the Evans, Danish, King’s and other gambits. The best openings to play are the ones you are most at home in. } 4... exd5 { Better than taking with the knight. Black keeps a pawn in the centre and frees his c8-bishop. } 5. Bg5 { White pins the knight and threatens to break up Black’s game by 6 Bxf6 gxf6 (6...Qxf6 loses the d5-pawn), when Black is left with a weak doubled pawn. } 5... Be7 { The simplest way of unpinning the knight. Moving the bishop only one square may not seem much of a move, but it complies with the first law of rapid development: Get your pieces off the back rank! } 6. Bd3 { This bishop’s stand is aggressive, especially against kingside castling. } 6... Nc6 { This knight’s debut is even more menacing, as it threatens to take the d-pawn. } 7. Nge2! { After the customary development 7 Nf3, Black pins the knight by 7...Bg4 and again threatens the d-pawn. White could save the pawn, for instance by 8 Be2, but would lose the initiative. After the text-move, if Black pins the knight by 7...Bg4, 8 f3 repels the bishop and causes it to lose time retreating. } (7. Nf3 Bg4 8. Be2) 7... Nb4 { Intending to get rid of a dangerous enemy piece and also to assure himself of a little advantage in keeping both his bishops. } (7... Bg4 8. f3) 8. Ng3 { Now we see another reason for developing the knight to e2. White wants to anchor a piece at f5, a dominating position for a knight or a bishop. A piece need do no more than just stand there and look menacing to rattle the opponent. } 8... Nxd3+ { Mission accomplished. Black has a slight technical superiority in retaining two long-range bishops against White’s knight and bishop, but... } 9. Qxd3 { ...at the cost of a loss of time. Black has made three moves with the knight to exchange it for a bishop that moved only once. More than that, his knight came off the board completely, while the bishop left a piece in its place. The result is that White has four active pieces in play against two of Black’s. White is also prepared to castle on either side and mobilize both rooks quickly. Whatever advantage exists is therefore White’s. } 9... g6 { This pawn move prevents White from placing his knight at f5, but it creates an organic weakness in Black’s position, one that is irremediable. The squares f6 and h6, no longer guarded by the pawn, are weak and remain so permanently. Notice that the pawn was induced but not forced to move forward. The mere threat of an inroad by the knight was enough to influence Black to make a natural preventive move. It is the sort of move nine out of ten players make automatically in similar situations, which is why it is important to know how to exploit its defects, for no move is weak unless proper advantage is taken of its flaws. } 10. O-O { No violence, please, until the reserves have been brought up. Blackburne used to say, “Never start an attack until your queen’s rook is developed.” White secures the safety of his king and gets one rook out of hiding. } 10... c6 { Strengthens Black’s pawn-centre and opens another avenue for his queen. } 11. Rae1 { White seizes the only open file (since rooks belong on open files or on files likely to be opened) and pins the bishop. It is worth noting that a pinned piece not only is unable to move but is also powerless to capture. It does not protect any other pieces, since it is completely paralysed. Hence it follows that not only is the bishop immobilized and in danger of its life (as it may be attacked again and again) but the knight that depends on it for protection is no longer secure. Briefly, Black is now threatened with loss of a piece by 12 Bxf6. } 11... O-O { The king takes refuge in flight, incidentally unpinning the bishop and preserving his knight. Spielmann’s strategy to this point and the decisive combination that follows would have pleased Lasker, who once said, “In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations, abstain from violent moves. Aim for small advantages, accumulate them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination – and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must exist, however deeply hidden.” A glance shows that White has achieved the requisite positional superiority. If there is a combination to be evolved, it must be now, before Black has time to reorganize his pieces for defence. Now, while he has five pieces actively in play against two of Black’s. Now, while he has an open file – enough! enough! The combination must be there! Here is White’s line of reasoning: Black’s advance of the g-pawn has deprived the knight of stable support. It is still guarded by two pieces, but if the bishop were not there it would be defended only once. In fact, if the bishop were not there, the knight would be pinned and subject to an enduring attack. The bishop appears in both equations. Obviously the bishop is the culprit, and it must be destroyed! And at once, before Black has time for 12...Be6! } 12. Rxe7!! { “When we know about the inspiring ideas, how simple the sacrifices appear!” says Znosko-Borovsky. } 12... Qxe7 { Black must recapture, leaving the knight pinned and a fine target for further attack. } 13. Qf3 { Putting pressure on the pinned piece, and threatening to take the knight. } 13... Kg7 { The king comes to the rescue of the knight. Against the alternative defence 13...Bf5 Spielmann had this pretty continuation: 14 Nxf5 gxf5 15 Qg3(threatening g mate on the move by 16 Bxf6#) 15...Kg7 (or 15...Kh8 16 Qh4 Kg7 17 Qh6+ Kg8 18 Bxf6 and White wins) 16 Bxf6++ Kxf6 17 Qh4+ Ke6 18 Re1+ Kd7 19 Qxe7+ and all Black’s pieces come off. } (13... Bf5 14. Nxf5 gxf5 15. Qg3 Kg7 16. Bxf6+ Kxf6 17. Qh4+) 14. Nce4! { White must keep hammering at the pinned knight, no matter how many brilliant moves he has to find! Again, White’s immediate threat is simple: 15 Bxf6+, winning instantaneously. } 14... dxe4 { Black must take this knight or lose his own. } 15. Nxe4 { Three pieces now attack the helpless knight. “Chess is not for the kind-hearted,” says the French proverb. White now threatens 16 Bxf6+ followed by 17 Bxe7. } 15... Qe6 { On 15...Qxe4 White has the pleasant choice of winning the queen by 16 Bxf6+ (removing the protector of the queen), followed by 17 Qxe4, or forcing mate by 16 Qxf6+ Kg8 17 Bh6 followed by 18 Qg7#. In the last line of play, notice how White screws his pieces firmly into the two holes in Black’s position, f6 and h6, the squares no longer guarded by the g-pawn after its advance. With his last move, Black saves the queen. He is still ahead in material but has a lost game, as White’s pieces will insinuate themselves along the dark squares to get at the king. } 1-0

1. d4 { One reason for the popularity of queen’s pawn openings is that from the very first move they present problems for the defender. T no method by which Black can seize the initiative or even equalize in a hurry. Despite its inherently positional nature, the queen’s pawn appeals tremendously to attacking players and has always been a favourite weapon of such aggressive spirits as Alekhine, Keres, Pillsbury, Bogoljubow, Spielmann and Colle. } 1... Nf6 { Brings a piece into play where it has an influence on the centre. The knight move prevents White from continuing with 2 e4. A master moves his knight to f6 as instinctively as he breathes. } 2. Nf3 { The knight develops toward the centre, where he has the greatest freedom of action and the widest scope for his activities. The knight possesses the peculiar property of being able to attack any other piece (except another knight) without being under attack in return. This attribute makes it a fascinating piece to manoeuvre about the board. Combinations involving play with the knights often have a ballet-like quality to them. } 2... e6 { Black can avoid the general attack of the Colle by playing 2...d5, ready to reply to 3 e3 with 3...Bf5. Then 4 Bd3 Bxd3 exchanges bishops and Black rids himself of White’s most dangerous attacking piece (in this form of the opening). With his actual move, Black releases his f8-bishop and does not commit himself to any specific line of defence. } 3. e3 { Indicating his design: obviously White is preparing the typical Colle formation of bishop at d3 and knight at d2, to control the key e4-square, a jumping-off point for the pieces in this attack. } 3... d5 { Black plants a pawn firmly in the centre but this move, in combination with 2...e6, does block in the c8-bishop. } 4. Bd3 { White begins the concentration of pressure on e4, essential in the Colle. Generally speaking, it is a good plan to mobilize the pieces on the kingside first, to enable early castling on that side. } 4... c5 { This move is almost indispensable in queen ’s pawn openings. It is important not to play ...Nc6 first, as Black’s c-pawn must not be obstructed. Black’s move strikes at the centre and establishes a state of tension in that area. } 5. c3 { White reinforces the d-pawn. In the event of 5...cxd4, White can recapture with the e-pawn and open the diagonal for the c1-bishop. It may seem that White’s last move denies the b1-knight his best square, but in this form of attack the knight belongs at d2. } 5... Nbd7 { This is probably superior to placing the knight at c6. At d7, the knights are in touch with each other, so that if the f6-knight is exchanged the other can get to f6, an ideal square for attack or defence. At d7, the knight keeps clear of the c-file. The more open the file is, the more useful will it be for the queen or rook that occupies it. Finally, should White play 6 dxc5, the knight can recapture and come strongly into the game. In queen’s pawn openings, Black’s queen’s knight often does a better job at d7 than at c6. } 6. Nbd2 { Intensifying the pressure on e4. To the uninitiated, White’s development has an awkward look. The pieces seem to be in each other’s way, but as will be seen they can spring into action smoothly and easily. } 6... Bd6 { More energetic than 6...Be7, when the bishop is limited to defensive duties. } 7. O-O { White secures the safety of his king before starting any decisive action. It is dangerous to open up the position and leave the king in the centre where it is exposed to a possible counterattack. White’s castling is aggressive in character as the king’s rook plays an important role in the coming attack. } 7... O-O { Black’s castling is a defensive measure. But why give the king’s permanent address when White has revealed that he is preparing an assault on the kingside? It would be better strategy to keep the opponent in the dark – delay castling for a while and continue developing the pieces (which surely can do no harm). Black might bring his queen to c7, with a view to an early ...e5, and then fianchetto his c8-bishop (...b6, followed by ...Bb7). } 8. Re1 { Still more pressure on e4! The rook gets a grip on the e-file; it is closed now but will be opened after White plays e4 and pawns are exchanged. } 8... Qc7 { An ideal location for the queen. From c7 the queen bears down on the centre, especially e5, and exerts great pressure on the c-file. } 9. e4! { The key move in the Colle! With this move White intends to blast the position wide open and release all the stored-up energy of his pieces in a searing attack. The immediate threat is 10 e5, a simple, brutal attack on two pieces. } 9... cxd4 { As compensation for being on the defensive, Black controls the open c-file – temporarily. } 10. cxd4 { Better than taking with the knight, which lets Black place pieces on e5 and c5. White meanwhile renews the threat of winning a piece by 11 e5. } 10... dxe4 { Black parries the threat and saddles White with an isolated d-pawn. Such a pawn is especially vulnerable to attack as it cannot be protected by another pawn, the nearest one being a couple of files away. } 11. Nxe4 { Certainly not 11 Bxe4 because 11...Nxe4 would be the response, and White loses the services of his valuable light-squared bishop. “As Rousseau could not compose without his cat beside him, so I without my king’s bishop cannot play chess,” says Tarrasch. “In its absence the game to me is lifeless and cold. The vitalizing factor is missing, and I can devise no plan of attack.” } 11... b6 { Intending to mobilize his c8-bishop. Somewhat more to the point was 11...Bf4 restraining one of White’s menacing bishops. } 12. Bg5 { The bishop joins the attack, and vacates the c1-square. The a1-rook will swing there, drive the queen off and assume complete control of a beautiful open file. } 12... Nxe4 { Apparently Black was afraid to play 12...Bb7 as the continuation 13 Nxf6+ Nxf6 14 Bxf6 gxf6 breaks up his kingside pawn position. } 13. Rxe4! { Superior to the natural 13 Bxe4, when Black might reply 13...Bb7 forcing 14 Bd3 (to avoid exchanging bishops). Then he could continue 14...Bxf3 15 Qxf3 Bxh2+ consoling himself with a pawn for his troubles. } 13... Bb7 { There is hardly anything better than this, which offers the bishop a long diagonal. If, for example, Black plays 13...Nf6, then 14 Rh4 is hard to meet. Then the threat of winning a pawn by 15 Bxf6 gxf6 16 Bxh7+ could not be parried by 14...h6 as 15 Bxf6 gxf6 16 Rxh6 still wins a pawn. } 14. Rc1 { A fine ‘in-between’ move! The rook is developed effectively on the open file, while the queen is banished to the first rank. There she interferes with the a8-rook, preventing its development for a long time – forever, as it turns out! } 14... Qb8 { There is nothing else as 14...Bxe4 15 Rxc7 Bxf3 16 Qxf3 Bxc7 17 Qc6 wins a piece for White. } 15. Rh4! { The point! White’s threat of 16 Bxh7+ forces one of the pawns in front of the king to move forward. White gets an advantage, no matter which pawn advances, as: Every pawn move loosens the defending structure. Every undefended square (occasioned by such an advance) creates a weakness in the position. } 15... g6 { If Black tries defending the h-pawn by 15...Nf6, then 16 Bxf6 gxf6 17 Bxh7+ wins the pawn just the same. Or if Black advances the h-pawn by 15...h6, then 16 Bxh6 gxh6 17 Rxh6 is an obvious sacrificial combination which shatters the cordon of pawns and exposes the king to a mating attack. After the text-move. White has accomplished what he set out to do: he has forced the advance of the g-pawn. But how does he exploit the resulting weakness? Is there an attack against the pawn? Apparently there isn’t, as in order to strike at it with the h-pawn, he must move the rook out of the way, and then play h4 and h5, a process which takes time and achieves little. What other line is there? Sacrifice a piece for the g-pawn? Obviously this is useless, as White still does not break through. But the pawn did advance, and there is a weakness somewhere. We know this fact to be true, and in this fact there must be the clue to the winning combination. The pawn’s advance weakened the squares h6 and f6, as they are no longer guarded by the pawn. This means that White must try to get control of these squares, either seize and occupy them with his pieces, or use them as a means of penetrating into the enemy camp. But wait! Doesn’t Black’s knight still guard the f6-square? Indeed it does, and this knowledge provides us with the information we need. The knight is the guardian of the dark squares, and the knight must be destroyed! } 16. Bb5! { Attacks the knight, which strangely enough has no place to escape to! } 16... Qe8 { What other way is there to protect the knight? If 16...Bc8, then 17Bc6 wins the exchange. If 16 ...Bxf3 17 Qxf3 Qe8, then 18 Qb7 wins a piece. After the actual move, the knight is pinned and a good target for further attack. } 17. Ne5 { In chess you may hit a man when he’s down. } 17... Bc8 { No better is 17 ...Bxe5 18 dxe5 (uncovering the queen’s attack on the knight) 18...Bc8 (or 18. . . Bd5) 19Rc7, when the miserable creature must perish. } 18. Rxc8! { Taking the props out from under the knight! The technique is simple: if you cannot increase the pressure on a piece, see if you can dispose of one of its defenders. } 18... Qxc8 { Certainly not 18...Rxc8, when 19 Bxd7 wins two pieces for a rook, and then corners the queen! } 19. Bxd7 { White has two pieces for the rook - and the attack! } 19... Qc7 { Not 19 ...Qb7 or 19... Qb8, as 20 Bc6 wins the exchange. The alternative was 19 . . . Qa6, but Black hopes for some counterplay on the c-file. } 20. Ng4! { The first step toward exploiting the weak dark squares brings with it a threat of mate by 21 Nf6+ Kh8 (21... Kg7 is the same) 22 Rxh7#. } 20... h5 { The king needs lots of room. The freeing attempt by 20...f5 loses to 21 Bxe6+ Kh8 (21 ...Kg7 22 Bh6+ wins the exchange) 22 Nf6 and resistance is hopeless. } 21. Nf6+ { The knight comes in on one of the critical dark squares to strike the first blow. } 21... Kg7 { If 21 ...Kh8, then 22Rxh5+ forces a quick mate. } 22. Nxh5+ { Sacrificing the knight to sweep away the pawns shielding the enemy king. } 22... gxh5 { Black must take the knight, because White mates after 22...Kg8 (or 22 ...Kh7) 23 Nf6+ Kg7 24 Rh7#. } 23. Qxh5 { The queen’s first move threatens two immediate mates on the h-file. } 23... Rh8 { The only move to stop mate - temporarily. Appropriately enough, White administers the coup de grâce on the second critical dark square. Mate follows in two moves. } 24. Bh6+ { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0

1. e4 { This first move occupies the centre with a pawn and frees four squares for the queen and five for the f 1-bishop. One of the reasons many players prefer 1 e4 to any other opening move is that it gets the kingside pieces rolling quickly, enabling early castling on that side. } 1... e5 { In the old days this was almost compulsory. It indicated that you were willing to stand toe-to-toe and slug it out. Only a coward would avoid 1...e5 and a possible gambit by White. Objectively considered, the text-move is perhaps Black’s strongest response. It challenges possession of the centre and prevents White from monopolizing it by continuing 2 d4. } 2. Nf3 { What happens if White persists and plays 2 d4? The reply 2...exd4 leads to 3 Qxd4 Nc6 4 Qe3 Nf6, when Black has two pieces in play to one of White’s. This amounts to taking the initiative away from White early in the game. The text-move is far more effective than random development of the knight, for instance at h3, where it is out of touch with affairs in the centre, or at e2, where it blocks all traffic. } 2... Nc6 { The logical way to meet the attack on the pawn; a minor piece develops toward the centre and defends the pawn. The general plan of mobilization is to establish a pawn in the centre, develop the minor pieces (the knights before bishops, whenever feasible), then castle to get the rooks to the centre files, and finally bring the queen out – but not too far from home. Premature development of the queen is dangerous, as it is subject to annoying attacks by pawns and minor pieces. } 3. Bb5 { The most natural move on the board: White strikes at the defender of the pawn he attacks. It is true that he cannot win the pawn at once, as after 4 Bxc6 dxc6 5 Nxe5 Qd4 Black regains the pawn, but the pressure on Black is constant, and the threat is always in the air. The Ruy Lopez is probably the strongest of all kingside openings. White has more to say in the centre, since he will be able to play d4 without much trouble, while Black will find it difficult to achieve ...d5. White’s pieces have more room to move around in, while Black’s game is considerably cramped in many variations. } 3... a6 { This can become like the story The House that Jack Built: the pawn attacks the bishop that attacks the knight that defends the pawn that the knight attacks. Black’s purpose is to dislodge the bishop from its favourable position. The loss of time involved in moving a pawn is compensated for by the fact that the threatened bishop must also lose a move in retreating. } 4. Ba4 { This is in the spirit of the opening as it maintains pressure on the knight. The alternative withdrawal to c4 is inferior, as the same position could have arisen after the move 3 Bc4, except that here Black has the additional move ...a6, which can only be to his benefit. } 4... Nf6 { Black develops a piece, attacks a pawn and prepares early kingside castling. More could hardly be expected of one move. } 5. O-O { White brings his king to safety and swings the rook over toward the centre files. } 5... Be7 { A favourite continuation with many players is 5 ...Nxe4, not with the idea of winning a pawn, as White regains it easily, but in order to obtain a free, open game. The danger in this line is that it leaves Black’s position in the centre somewhat insecure. The text leads to a more blocked position, difficult to break through, but requires patience on Black’s part. The bishop’s development at e7 is satisfactory even though it has moved only one square away from home. The important thing is that it has left the back rank and facilitated castling. } 6. Re1 { White brings his rook toward the centre. In lieu of an open file, the rook prepares to take command of a file liable to be opened. In guarding his own e-pawn, White renews the threat of 7 Bxc6 dxc6 8 Nxe5 winning a pawn. The rook’s move is preferable to developing the b1-knight to c3. White may want to provide a retreat for his bishop by c3, guarding it against an exchange. } 6... b5 { White meets the threat by forcing the bishop back. } 7. Bb3 { Obviously the only move. } 7... d6 { Black protects the e-pawn, releases the c8-bishop and prepares 8 . . . Na5 to remove the troublesome enemy bishop. At first glance it seems illogical to give one bishop freedom while hemming in the other, but since the dark-squared bishop does a good job at e7, it remains for the light-squared bishop to go out into the world. } 8. c3 { With two objects: } 8... Na5 { Not so much to strike at the bishop as to make way for 9...c5 to dispute control of the central squares. In this line of the Lopez, Black’s best counter-chances lie in action on the queenside. } 9. Bc2 { Naturally, White wants to keep both bishops. He loses a tempo, but it is offset by Black’s posting of a knight at the side of the board. } 9... c5 { Black intensifies his pressure on the central square d4 and provides an egress (as the old books used to say) for the queen. } 10. d4 { One of the chief objectives in king’s pawn openings is to advance the d-pawn to the centre as soon as circumstances permit, just as in queen’s pawn openings it is desirable to get the e-pawn to e4 when there is an opportunity to do so. White again threatens to win the e-pawn by the double attack on it. } 10... Qc7 { Black gives his pawn further support and develops his queen at the same time. It would not do to exchange by 10...exd4 11 cxd4 cxd4 12 Nxd4 as it surrenders the centre and leaves Black with an isolated centre pawn. “An isolated pawn,” says Tartakower, “casts gloom over the entire chessboard.” White would benefit too in that his knight, standing firmly in the centre of the board, could not be dislodged by unfriendly pawns. } 11. h3 { To prevent the pin ....Bg4, which might embarrass the knight and the piece it shields, the queen. Both pieces are needed for the protection of the d-pawn and the maintenance of the pawn formation in the centre. An exchange of the white knight by ....Bxf3, and the recapture by the queen, removes at one stroke two supports of the d-pawn. Is White violating principle in moving one of the pawns near his king? Maybe, but one must know when to slight conventions as well as observe them. In this particular situation it is important to prevent an attack on the knight, its subsequent exchange and the break-up of White’s pawns in the centre. The move of the h-pawn is weakening, but a lesser evil than would result from permitting the pin. But wait a moment! Is it a weakening move if Black is unable to benefit by it? Is it detrimental to the position if Black cannot exploit it by a kingside attack? The answer is no! A move is weak only if the opponent can turn its imperfections to his advantage. The entire position is strong or weak only in relation to the position of the opponent. In this case, the move of the h-pawn is expedient as it conforms to the requirements of the specific position. } 11... Nc6 { The knight returns and adds weight to the pressure on the d-pawn. Black threatens a series of exchanges by 12...exd4 13 cxd4 cxd4, resulting in the gain of a pawn, as the further sequence 14 Nxd4? Nxd4 15 Qxd4 Qxc2 would cost White a piece. Black hopes to tempt White into playing 12 d5 to meet this threat. This looks good, as it would evict the c6-knight from a good post, but it has the drawback (for White) of releasing the tension in the centre, as well as making d5 unavailable for the use of his pieces. } 12. Be3 { White is in no hurry. He brings aid to the d-pawn by developing another piece. } 12... O-O { Removing the king to safer quarters and pressing the rook into active service. } 13. Nbd2 { This knight has been developed where he has little mobility and seems to have no future to speak of, but it is the first step that counts. Little as this is, its consequence is worth emphasizing: The knight’s move clears the first rank and enables the major pieces (the queen and the rooks) to get in touch with each other. Get your pieces off the back rank and into active play! } 13... Bd7 { Black does likewise: his bishop vacates the back row to let the rooks come to the centre files. The rooks are powerful pieces and must not be shut in. } 14. Rc1 { In the early stages of the game, the rooks may not do much but they must be ready for action when it comes. This they best do by placing themselves at the head of open files. If none are available, then they should work on partly open files. If none of those exist, the rooks should still be brought toward the centre, as those files are most likely to be opened. But in any case, get the rooks out of the corners! } 14... Ne8 { Planning to advance the f-pawn. This pawn will dispute the centre with White’s e-pawn while opening the f-file for the rook. } 15. Nf1 { The knight retreats to gain momentum for a leap to g3 and then f5, a beautiful outpost. } 15... g6 { Not only to keep the knight out but also to support 16...f5, a thrust at the centre. The advance of the g-pawn weakens the squares f6 and h6, as they are no longer guarded by the pawn. This may strike the average player as an interesting but perhaps insignificant point, but recognizing a weakness and knowing how to take advantage of it marks the master player. Good players do not win games by waiting for you to make monumental mistakes. They don’t expect you to leave pieces en prise. } 16. Bh6 { White immediately anchors a piece on one of the vulnerable kingside squares. } 16... Ng7 { The only move to prevent loss of the exchange by 17 Bxf8. } 17. Ne3 { The knight comes back into the game by a slightly different route than was planned earlier. Not only does it add to the pressure on d5 but it also threatens to settle down powerfully on that square. } 17... Rae8 { Black could not stop the knight coming in by 17 ...Be6, as 18 d5 in reply wins a piece. He also abandons the contemplated break by 17...f5, as it opens the position, and open lines favour the player whose development is superior and who is better equipped to use these lines in an attack. With his actual move, Black tries to keep a tightly knit defensive position, one that is difficult to break through. } 18. Nd5! { A very fine move whose object is more profound than the obvious one of fixing a piece on a strong central square. } 18... Qb7 { The queen must flee from the knight’s attack. } 19. Nxe7+! { This is the point! The knight gives up his good position for a worthy cause. It is important, in order to capitalize on the weakness of the dark square f6, to remove the guardian of this square, the dark-squared bishop on e7. With this bishop out of the way the weakness is accentuated and White can then consider some means of invading, and then fastening a piece, on the critical square. } 19... Rxe7 { This is forced, as 19 ...Nxe7 20 dxe5 dxe5 21 Nxe5 costs a pawn. } 20. dxc5 { The purpose of this exchange is to open a nice long file for the queen. } 20... dxc5 { Black must recapture or lose a pawn. } 21. Qd6 { Beautiful exploitation of the open d-file! The attack on the c-pawn gains a tempo toward the queen’s entry at f6. } 21... c4 { Black must lose a move in saving this pawn. } 22. Qf6! { With this move, which incidentally threatens instant mate, White fastens another piece in the holes in Black’s position created by the move ...g6. White’s advantage is decisive and the winning procedure should be what the books call ‘a matter of technique’. The process of realizing his advantage is an interesting one. } 22... Nh5 { Black stops the mate and attempts to drive the queen away. } 23. Qh4 { It would be a mistake to play 23 Qg5 as Black, instead of moving his threatened rook on f8, would first play 23...f6, banishing the queen completely from his premises. } 23... Ng7 { The knight blocks the bishop’s attack on the rook and is prepared to counter 24 Qf6 by 24 ...Nh5, repeating the device of harassing the enemy queen. How does White continue, to force a win? } 24. Be3! { By rearranging his pieces and bringing up the reserves! This First move in the new formation gains time by the threat of 25 Bc5 winning the exchange. } 24... Ne6 { The only way to prevent 25 Bc5, after which White completely dominates the dark squares. } 25. Qf6 { Once more into the breach! Black cannot save the game by repeating moves, since after 25 ...Ng7 26 Bc5 Re6 (or 26 ...Nh5 27 Qh4, and White wins the exchange) 27 Qh4 Rfe8 28 Ng5 the threat of mate will win the rook at e6. } 25... Qc7 { Black must hang on to the valuable e-pawn. } 26. Bh6 { Once again White has his ideal position, with pieces firmly planted in the holes near Black’s king. It will be hard for Black to chase them off as he does not have the earlier resource of . . . Nh5. } 26... Rc8 { The rook must flee the bishop’s attack. Interposing the knight instead is of course a blunder as mate follows instantaneously. } 27. Rcd1 { Before proceeding to the final attack, White gets a stronger grip on the position by seizing the open d-file. The next step (since Black must wait helplessly) is 28 Rd5, attacking the e-pawn a third time and threatening to double rooks on the file. This ought to be enough to beat down resistance if no quicker win is available. Note that White has not embarked on dubious long-range combinations. His plan, in most cases aimed at increasing his positional superiority, is made for a few moves only. Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead. They don’t do this because they don’t have to! It is far easier and more to the point to look only a few moves ahead and try to maintain at least an equal game at every stage. Winning by accumulating small advantages is more consistent with a common-sense approach than to seek to overwhelm the opponent with bewildering combinations and venturesome sacrificial attacks. Strengthening one’s own position gradually while undermining that of the opponent is more important than indulging in fruitless speculative fancies. } 27... Ree8 { Black’s idea is to reduce the pressure by offering an exchange of queens. White will then either have to acquiesce to the exchange, or withdraw his queen. } 28. Nh2! { A very fine move! The knight, which seemed well posted at f3, is re-routed to augment the pressure on the dark squares. } 28... Qd8 { Continuing the plan of evicting White’s queen from his camp. } 29. Ng4! { White supports his queen and is ready, in the event of an exchange of queens, to maintain a tight grip on the dark squares. If Black plays 29 ...Qxf6, then 30 Nxf6+ Kh8 31 Rxd7 wins a piece for White. } 29... Qe7 { This does not help, but there is no way to save the game: if 29 ...Re7, then 30 Be3 (threatening 31 Nh6+ Kf8 32 Qh8#) 30 ...Re8 31 Nh6+ Kf8 32 Qxf7#. } 30. Qxe7 { The simplest. If no mate is in sight, the modern master dispenses with the fireworks. Dawdling is for dilettantes, so he simplifies and cuts down any chance of resistance. After 30 ...Rxe7 31 Nf6+ Kh8 32 Rxd7 White wins a piece, giving Black no opportunity to complicate the ending. } 1-0

1. e4 { This opening move makes an outlet for two pieces, the queen and light-squared bishop. It does more than that. It frees a square for the king and gives an extra one to the g1-knight. It is true that the knight is best developed at f3, but there are times when it is expedient to bring it to e2 – perhaps to reach f5 by way of g3. It is just as well to add to the knight’s freedom of movement, if no time is lost thereby. As to the king, there’s no harm in letting him have a bit more breathing space too. Many a king has been smothered by a lack of consideration, or by carelessness. Consider this case history, from a minor tournament: McGrouther-McCann, Dundee 1893: 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 e5 5 Nf5 Nge7 6 Nd6# (1-0). And if this seems farfetched, here is another specimen, again in a minor tournament: Arnold-Böhm, Munich 1932: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Nd7 5 Qe2 Ngf6 6 Nd6# (1-0) . } 1... e6 { Though less aggressive than 1...e5, this move does release two pieces and has the advantage of restricting White’s choice of attack. White no longer has the whole range of Open Games at his disposal, and he is less able to steer the game into highly tactical channels by adopting an opening such as the King’s Gambit. The French Defence conceals a great deal of potential dynamic energy and is a fine weapon against an over-enthusiastic attacking player. Black’s position is not easily assaulted despite its cramped appearance. } 2. d4 { As strong as it is natural. Of this pawn formation, Staunton, in the nineteenth century, said, “It is generally advantageous for your pawns to occupy the middle of the board, because when there they greatly retard the movements of the opposing forces. The e-pawn and the d-pawn at their fourth squares are well posted, but it is not easy to maintain them in that position, and if you are driven to advance one of them, the power of both is much diminished.” } 2... d5 { Black attacks the e-pawn while giving his queen more mobility. It is important to dispute control of the centre. } 3. Nd2 { White has two reasons for developing the knight at d2: It is true that his c1-bishop is blocked, but this condition is only temporary. Pieces can get out of each other ’s way. } 3... Nf6 { If followed up correctly, there is nothing wrong with this move. The idea is that by attacking the e4-pawn, Black aims to force this pawn forward to e5. As Staunton explained above, once White’s two central pawns do not stand abreast, his whole central structure is weakened. An alternative and equally good plan was to fight for control of the centre by 3...c5, incidentally permitting his queen the use of another diagonal and access to the queenside. } 4. e5 { Why does White disregard Staunton’s advice about keeping two pawns on the fourth rank? He knows that the pawn may be weaker at e5, but he weighs strengths and weaknesses. At e5 the pawn drives the knight away from its most useful post and sends it off to another square where it interferes with the free movements of Black’s other pieces. Clearly, the value of this or any other move is arrived at by balancing the benefits it confers against any disadvantages that might accrue. } 4... Nfd7 { Just about the only move left. On 4 . . . Ne4, White plays 5 Nxe4 dxe4 and then has the pleasant choice between 6 Bc4 and 6 Be3. In both cases White controls more space and has free development for his pieces. Black, on the other hand, has to worry about his pawn on e4, which is disconnected from the rest of his forces and extremely vulnerable to attack. } 5. Bd3 { White gets his kingside pieces rolling to facilitate early castling on that side. } 5... c5 { Very good, as Black must not delay in trying to free his constricted position. The pawn move strikes at the centre and opens another path for Black’s queen. } 6. c3 { Ready to reply to 6...cxd4 with 7 cxd4, and preserve the pawn-chain, which so cramps the enemy. } 6... Nc6 { The knight develops with tempo, as the d-pawn is now twice attacked. } 7. Ne2! { One of those rare times when the knight belongs here instead of at f3. It is true that f3 should be occupied by a knight, and White will arrange to have one there. His plan is to swing the knight from d2 to f3, meanwhile freeing his c 1-bishop. } 7... Qb6 { Black puts more pressure on the white d-pawn, threatening to win it by 8...cxd4 9 cxd4 Nxd4 10 Nxd4 Qxd4. } 8. Nf3 { A clever knight shift protects the pawn and clears the decks for the dark-squared bishop’s appearance. } 8... Be7 { Another plausible move, but far too passive. Black’s position is cramped by the chain of enemy pawns on d4 and e5, and he should not allow this situation to persist. He must try to break White’s grip on the centre to obtain more space for his pieces. The correct continuation was 8...cxd4 9 cxd4 f6, virtually forcing 10 exf6 Nxf6. Then the problem with the d7-knight blocking in the c8-bishop has been resolved, and the disappearance of the e5-pawn means that Black has gained the d6-square for the development of his dark-squared bishop. If Black does not take the necessary liberating action, then he is likely to be gradually squeezed to death. Such a fate befell even so great a player as Capablanca in his game with Alekhine at AVRO 1938. As a consequence of his inferior opening play, Capablanca was tied up so badly that he could not stir and that he resigned with nearly all his pieces still on the board. } 9. O-O { The king must be spirited off to a safer spot before any violent action is undertaken. } 9... O-O { Black is still playing mechanical chess, unconscious of possible danger. With this move he misses the last chance of striking at the pawn chain by 9...f6. } 10. Nf4! { Definitely putting an end to any possibility of disturbing the line-up of pawns, as 10...f6 is refuted by 11 Nxe6, while 10...cxd4 11 cxd4 Nxd4 12 Nxd4 Qxd4 13 Bxh7+, uncovering an attack on the queen, is unthinkable. } 10... Nd8 { Black recognizes at last that his pieces will remain impotent until he rids the board of White’s annoying e-pawn. He therefore protects his own e-pawn so that he can enforce 11...f6 and break up White’s pawn formation. } 11. Qc2 { Creating an obvious threat to the black h-pawn. The profound purpose of the move is to compel one of the pawns near the king to move forward. The advance of any pawn around the king loosens the defensive structure and results in a permanent weakening which can be exploited, while the pawn that made the forward step itself often becomes a target for direct attack. } 11... f5 { What choice is there? If Black plays 11...h6 or 11...g6, he can never afterward play ...f6 without making the g6-square vulnerable to invasion by White’s pieces or the focal point of a sacrificial attack that would demolish his kingside. } 12. exf6 { This relaxes the bind on Black, but it opens up lines for an attack. Open lines favour the player whose development is superior and whose pieces enjoy greater mobility. } 12... Nxf6 { Not only to get the knight back into the game but also to defend his h-pawn, which again was threatened. } 13. Ng5 { Once more attacking the pawn, this time including a threat of 14 Bxh7+ Kh8 (14 ...Nxh7 15 Qxh7#) 15 Ng6#. } 13... g6 { Forced, as 13...h6 saves the pawn but allows the mate. With the advance of the g-pawn, a target comes into view at which White can direct his attack. He can visualize a decisive blow, one that will wreck Black’s entire defensive structure! } 14. Bxg6! { This sacrifice must be accepted, as otherwise Black will be a pawn down with nothing to show for it but a shattered position. If he tries 14...h6, then 15 Bh7+ Kg7 16 Qg6+ Kh8 17 Qxh6, and the threat of mate by the knight as well as the danger of discovered check is too much to withstand. } 14... hxg6 { One lone pawn remains of the three which surrounded the king, and even that one is not long for this world. } 15. Qxg6+ { With this dramatic entrance on the scene, the queen, attended by her two knights, will quickly force submission. } 15... Kh8 { The only move. } 16. Qh6+ { Clearing the g6-square for the knight. } 16... Kg8 { Interposing the knight instead allows mate on the move. The threats of mate by 18 Qh8# or 18 Nxe7# cannot both be parried. } 17. Ng6 { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0

1. d4 { In chess, unlike tennis, you cannot win by serving an ace. There is no trick move in the opening that will catch even a fair-to-middling player off-balance. What you can do is apply order and method in your conduct of this phase, so as to increase your chances of getting a favourable position. All you need do is follow a few simple rules for sound development: Capablanca summed all this up when he said, “The main thing is to develop the pieces quickly: get them into play as fast as you can.” Now back to Flohr and Pitschak: White’s first move fixes a pawn in the centre and liberates two pieces. } 1... Nf6 { Black brings his king’s knight out to its most favourable post and hinders White from continuing with 2 e4. } 2. Nf3 { Napier recalls that in the first of several lessons he took from Steinitz, the World Champion said, “No doubt you move your knight out on each side before the bishop? And do you know why?” Napier says he was stuck for an intelligent answer. Steinitz went on to explain: “One good reason is that you know where the knight belongs before you know that much of your bishop; certainty is a far better friend than doubt.” } 2... e6 { Black postpones the straightforward reply 2...d5, which lets him in for the regular lines of the Queen’s Gambit. Meanwhile he opens a line for the f8 -bishop. } 3. Nbd2 { A typical knight manoeuvre in the Colle Attack: the knight puts pressure on the critical e4-square without blocking the c-file. } 3... c5 { Black strikes a blow at the d-pawn in an attempt to secure control of the centre. This flank thrust is almost compulsory in queen’s pawn openings because Black must try to disturb White’s central formation. The immediate threat is 4...cxd4, so that the recapture by 5 Nxd4 leaves no white pawn remaining in the centre. } 4. e3 { White shores up the d-pawn and provides an outlet for the f1-bishop. } 4... b6 { Black too props up his advanced pawn and prepares to fianchetto the c8-bishop. } 5. Bd3 { Customary practice in this system of attack: the bishop adds his strength to the pressure exerted on e4 in preparation for an advance by the e-pawn, which will open up lines of attack for the pieces in the background. The bishop also aims at Black’s h-pawn, a fine target after the enemy king castles on that side. } 5... Bb7 { This solves one of Black’s chief problems in queen’s pawn openings – an effective disposition of the light-squared bishop. By means of this fianchetto arrangement, the bishop commands the longest diagonal on the board and participates in the fight for domination of e4, the strategic square in the Colle System. } 6. O-O { As part of the process of development, White shields his king from danger and brings his rook closer to the centre files. } 6... Be7 { Despite its modest appearance, there is a great deal of latent energy in the placement of this bishop at e7. It is close enough to home to help defend the king, yet easily manoeuvrable to a more aggressive post if occasion requires. } 7. c4 { More in the spirit of the Colle formation is the quiet 7 c3 to supply a support for the d4-pawn. The e-pawn is then free to advance, and if Black at any time plays ...cxd4, White recaptures with the c-pawn and maintains a strong pawn in the centre. The idea of the text-move apparently is to prevent Black’s pieces from using d5 as a pivot for their movements about the board. } 7... O-O { Black goes quietly about the business of mustering out all the troops. At one stroke his rook appears on the scene while the king is whisked away. } 8. b3 { Clearly in order to develop the bishop at b2. This fianchettoing of the bishop is not conventional procedure in the Colle, but Flohr may have wanted to test some ideas of his own. } 8... d5 { Black seizes the opportunity to dispute possession of the centre. He also puts an end to White’s contemplated advance of the e-pawn, as he bears down on the critical e4-square with knight, pawn and bishop, while White has only two pieces trained on it. It is true that the b7-bishop’s diagonal is blocked, but this condition is only temporary. } 9. Qc2 { Considerably better was the simple development of the dark-squared bishop at b2 , which he prepared with his previous move. The purpose of 9 Qc2 is to secure control of e4 and to prevent Black from establishing an outpost on that square by 9...Ne4. The trouble with the move is that it permits Black to seize the initiative and thereafter direct the course of events. } 9... Nc6 { A powerful move which combines development, aggressive intent and prophylaxis! Development, in that the knight is placed at once on its most suitable square. Aggression, in the knight’s threat to advance to b4, attacking queen and bishop and forcing an exchange which rids the board of White’s dangerous light-squared bishop. Prophylaxis, in the prevention of 10 e4, the continuation after which would be 10 ...Nb4 11 Qc3 xd3 12 Qxd3 dxe4, and Black wins apiece. } 10. a3 { White must preserve his valuable light-squared bishop. Unfortunately, the time lost in being forced to make a pawn move is costly, as we shall see. } 10... cxd4 { Black exchanges to clarify the position in the centre and to open the c-file for the convenience of his a8-rook. } 11. cxd5 { The alternative capture 11 exd4 was unpleasant as the reply 11...dxc4 forces 12 Qxc4 (otherwise White’s d-pawn is lost), when 12...Rc8 exercises uncomfortable pressure on White’s centre. Another possibility instead of the text-move is 11 Nxd4 Nxd4 12 exd4 dxc4 13 Qxc4 (to save the d-pawn) 13 ...Rc8 14 Qa4 Bc6 15 Qxa7 (or 15 Qc4 Bxg2 and Black wins easily) 15 ...Ra8 and Black wins the queen. } 11... Qxd5 { Black nets a pawn with this and (as if it were not enough) takes over the attack. The queen is in no danger, as White’s pieces are not sufficiently well developed to cause her any inconvenience. } 12. exd4 { White opens the position to get some counterplay; he hopes to utilize the e-file for his rook and the e4-square as a pivot for his pieces. Instead the superficially attractive 12 e4 does not accomplish much, as after 12...Qh5 the vital e4-square is occupied by a pawn, making it unavailable for the manoeuvring of pieces, while Black benefits in having an extra passed pawn on the d-file. } 12... Nxd4 { This attack on the queen gains time as White must lose a move with his queen. } 13. Qb1 { Obviously 13 Nxd4 would not do, as Black’s queen pounces down with instantaneous mate, while 13 Qb2 Nxf3+ 14 Nxf3 Qxd3 costs a piece. On 13 Qc3, Black continues 13 ...Rfd8 followed by 14...Rac8, and again the queen must flee. White’s actual move is probably the least of the evils. } 13... Rfd8 { Intensifying the pressure along the d-file and particularly on the bishop, whose life is threatened by 14 ... Nxf3+ 15 Nxf3 Qxd3 16 Qxd3 Rxd3. } 14. Ne1 { White protects his bishop as well as the vulnerable g-pawn. Against 14 Bc2 Black can choose from these themes: 1) Simplification (being a pawn ahead), by 14...Nxc2. 2) Stepping up the pressure by 14...Rac8, banishing the c2-bishop to the first rank. 3) Combination, by 14 ...Ne2+ 15 Kh1 Ba6 (threatening to win the exchange by 16...Nc3) 16 Re1 Ng4 17 Ne4 Qxe4! 18 Bxe4 Nxf2#. } 14... Qh5! { There is no direct threat in this queen move, but Black threatens to threaten! He intends to storm White’s citadel of pawns with his queen supported by a minor piece, for instance by 15...Bd6 or 15...Ng4. This would compel one of the pawns to leave its base and create weaknesses that Black could exploit. The advanced pawn itself might be susceptible to attack, or avenues might be opened leading to the king. This chipping away at the foundation is an interesting process for rendering an apparently strongly fortified position vulnerable to assault. } 15. Bb2 { White has no dependable defence (especially against nebulous threats) so continues to develop his pieces. The more he has in play, the better his chances of surviving the coming storm. } 15... Bd6 { With a simple but unmistakable threat: mate on the move! How does White defend? 1) 16 Nef3 Nxf3+ 17 Nxf3 Bxf3 18 gxf3 Qxh2#. 2) 16 f4 Bc5 (threatening the deadly 17...Ne2++ 18 Kh1 Ng3#) 17 Kh1 Ng4 18 h3 Qxh3+ and mate next move. 3) 16 h3 Qe5 (again aiming for mate at h2) 17 g3 Qd5 (now trying for 18...Qh1#) 18 f3 Qg5, and White’s game falls to pieces. } 16. g3 { By a process of elimination, the only defence, if one still exists. } 16... Ng4 { White’s g-pawn has been compelled to step forward; now the threat of 17...Qxh2# forces the h-pawn’s advance. } 17. h4 { White has no other move than this, which keeps the queen out – or does it? } 17... Qxh4! { This is brilliant! Not because of the fact that the queen is offered, but because it brings to an appropriate climax the systematic exploitation of pawn weaknesses cleverly brought into being. Black introduces two threats of mate in one, at h1 and h2. After 18 gxh4 the reply 18...Bh2# would come quick as a flash. } 0-1

1. c4 { Despite the fact that only one piece is freed by this move, against the two that are released by 1 e4 or 1 d4, the English is one of the strongest opening weapons in White’s arsenal. It appeals to those who like originality right from the start, as it allows manoeuvring of the pieces without coming to grips too early with the enemy. In many forms of this opening, White does not even try to occupy the centre. He lets Black mass pieces and pawns there, and then attacks them from the sides. He might fianchetto his bishops, for example, and strike at the centre from a distance, in order to undermine it. Should White decide to temper his originality with caution, he can transpose from the English to some form of queen’s pawn opening and still retain a fine game. } 1... e5 { Black develops in the good old-fashioned way: he plants a pawn in the centre and frees two pieces for action. } 2. Nc3 { White brings a piece out in preference to advancing a centre pawn. In fact, on 2 d4 exd4 3 Qxd4 Nc6 the queen must retreat and lose a move. Or if 2 e4, White remains with a backward d-pawn, while the f1-bishop cannot get to c4. } 2... Nf6 { Black watches the order of his moves. The knight move is not merely routine development of a piece. Its purpose is to offset the pressure of White’s knight and pawn on the d5-square. } 3. g3 { Clearly with the intention of making room for the bishop at g2, where it will operate on a long diagonal and also contribute to the pressure on d5. } 3... d5! { Black frees his game by opening new paths for the queenside pieces. Simultaneously, he puts the question to White’s c-pawn. } 4. cxd5 { White is happy to exchange a flank pawn for a centre pawn. At the same time, his c-file, now clear of pawns, offers good prospects for his queen’s rook when it gets to c1. } 4... Nxd5 { Such recaptures are practically compulsory. A delay might give White time to protect and hold on to the extra pawn. } 5. Bg2 { White develops a piece with gain of tempo – an attack on the d5-knight. In the old days, Black would probably have met this by 5...Be6, protecting the knight while developing another piece. Today’s players regard with suspicion even the most natural moves, in their search for truth (and new ways to win). } 5... Nb6! { The bishop can wait! The advantage of this move is that Black is able to retain control of the d4-square, and so prevent White from opening up the centre by advancing his d-pawn to d4. After 5...Be6, on the other hand, play might continue 6 Nf3 Nc6 7 O-O Be7 8 d4, when Black is in trouble, since the position is becoming open while his king is still in the centre. } 6. Nf3 { Again one of White’s pieces develops with a threat – this time against the e-pawn. } 6... Nc6 { Black defends in the simplest, most natural, way by posting the b8-knight on its most effective station. Despite the fact that Black has fewer pieces in play than White, his game is not inferior. He does have a pawn in the centre, and his bishops, undeveloped as yet, have great potential, as their cruising range is more extensive than White’s. } 7. O-O { White does not commit himself, but spirits away the king and mobilizes one of his rooks. } 7... Be7 { As in the previous game, the bishop’s unobtrusive position at e7 is deceptive: it is prepared to keep out invaders and is also on the alert to switch to the attack. } 8. d3 { White makes room for the c1-bishop to take a hand in the game. } 8... O-O { Removes the king from the danger area and gets the rook up on deck. } 9. Be3 { With the bishop on this square, White may be able to get in 10 d4 and rid himself of Black’s cramping centre pawn. } 9... Bg4! { An excellent deployment, as the bishop has a powerful restraining effect on White’s kingside, as well as on the contemplated advance of his d-pawn. If White does try 10 d4, the response 10...Nc4 is hard to meet. If White replies 11 Nxe5, then after 11...N6xe5 12 dxe5 Nxe3 13 fxe3 he is left with a rickety column of pawns on the e-file. Or if White plays 11 Qc1 to save his b-pawn and to recapture at e3 with the queen, then 11...Nxe3 12 Qxe3 exd4 13 Qe4 Bxf3, followed by 14...dxc3, wins a piece for Black. White’s best line is probably 10 Na4, in order to swing the knight to c5, a square which White must try to control in this type of English Opening. Otherwise he might continue developing by 10 Rc1 and only then consider the knight manoeuvre. } 10. h3 { A move which is impelled by a desire to make the annoying bishop declare his intentions – either take the knight or vacate the premises! Unfortunately, moves such as this, dictated more by instinct than reason, have an injurious effect on the castled position, as the structure is loosened. Once the pawns near the king make a move, they themselves become more susceptible to attack, in spite of the cluster of pieces ranged around them for protection. } 10... Bh5 { The bishop retreats one square but maintains the pressure. Despite the bishop’s restricted mobility, its continued influence is more troublesome to White’s position (and his frame of mind) than would be its return to e6, where it enjoys more freedom but does nothing to disturb the opponent. } 11. Rc1 { Evidently in order to control the c-file and perhaps work up an attack on the queenside. A good alternative is 11 Qb3 followed, when feasible, by Rad1 and d4, to open the d-file for White’s rooks and get some counterplay in the centre. Action in the centre is the best remedy against a kingside attack. } 11... Qd7 { All the pieces must do their bit! The queen moves only one step forward and dominates an important diagonal! Development of the queen serves another purpose in that the first rank is cleared for the rooks. They can now switch over toward the centre and get control of the most important files. } 12. Na4 { White’s idea is to create a diversion by taking command of c5 with his knight and keeping Black occupied with threats on the queenside. Against routine defensive moves, for instance 12 Kh2, Black gets an attack rolling by 12...f5 and 13...f4, and the pawn will demolish White’s kingside pawn formation. } 12... Bxf3 { Presenting White with an unhappy choice of recaptures: if he takes with the pawn, his d-pawn becomes isolated and weak; if he takes with the bishop, he loses a pawn immediately. } 13. Bxf3 { White gives up the h-pawn, trusting that he will regain a pawn quickly by his next exchange of pieces. } 13... Qxh3 { After this capture, Black’s attacking prospects are very bright. Without bothering to analyse the petty details, he can visualize winning lines of play beginning with 14...f5 followed either by 15...f4, to destroy White’s g-pawn (the key to the defensive structure), or by 15...Rf6, and then swinging the rook over to g6 or h6. } 14. Bxc6 { Better than this, which regains the pawn, is 14 Bg2 banishing the queen from the neighbourhood of his king. } 14... bxc6 { Forced, but an agreeable obligation. Black is quite pleased to see the last of this long-range bishop. } 15. Rxc6 { Material is now equal, but the white king is in danger, with the enemy queen breathing on his neck. } 15... Nd5! { A tremendous move! One threat from this beautifully centralized knight is 16...Nxe3 17 fxe3 Qxg3+ 18 Kh1 Qh3+ 19 Kg1 Bg5, and White’s game is in ruins, while another threat is 16...Nf6, followed by 17...Ng4 and 18...Qh2#. } 16. Qe1 { This awkward move is absolutely necessary to save the g-pawn from 16...Nxe3 17 fxe3 Qxg3+. Should this pawn fall, his king could not withstand the attack. White may have intended to play 16 Bc5, when after 16...Nf6 he could have put up a fight by 17 Rxf6 Bxf6 18 Bxf8, but at the last moment saw the refutation: 16...Bxc5 17 Nxc5 Nf6, and in order to stop 18...Ng4 and 19...Qh2#, he must give up his rook for the knight, a course which means an eventual loss. } 16... f5! { Not at once 16...Nf6 as 17 f3 keeps the knight out (note how essential it is to have the g-pawn protected). With his last move Black prepares to play 17...f4. If 18 gxf4 then 18...Rxf4 19 Bxf4 Nxf4, and Black mates at g2. If White does not take the pawn but plays 18 Bc5, Black wins cleverly by 18...f3 (threatening 19...Qg2#) 19 exf3 Nf4 (again aiming at the mate) 20 gxf4 Rf5, and White can only stop 21...Rh5, followed by mate, by giving up his queen with 21 Qxe5. } 17. Bc5 { If White tries to rid himself of Black’s troublesome knight by 17 Nc3 Black pursues the attack by 17...Nf6 18 f3 Nh5 (concentrating on the vital g-pawn) 19 Bf2 Bh4 (still hammering at the pawn) 20 gxh4 Nf4 and forces mate at g2. The text-move gives White a faint chance of holding out after 17...Bxc5 18 Nxc5 Nf6 19 f3, or if 17...Nf6 then 18 Rxf6. } 17... f4! { Not only to strike at the g-pawn but also to clear a path for the rook’s passage to f5 and h5 to assist the queen in a mating operation. } 18. Bxe7 { If instead 18 g4 to keep the rook out, Black has three or four easy wins on tap: 1) 18...f3 19 exf3 Nf4, followed by mate at g2. 2) 18...Qxg4+ 19 Kh2 and then: 2a) 19...Rf5, and the rook mates. 2b) 19...f3 20 Rg1 Qh4#. The move played exchanges to reduce the number of pieces besetting his king. He hopes for the simple recapture by 18...Nxe7, when the knight, no longer centralized, is less of a menace. } 18... fxg3 { With the simple, brutal threat of 19...Qh2#. } 19. fxg3 { The only reply. } 19... Ne3! { Threatening 20...Qg2#. There is no defence: 20 Rf2 Qxg3+ 21 Kh1 Rxf2 wins easily, or 20 Rxf8+ Rxf8 21 Qf2 Rxf2 22 Kxf2 Qg2+ 23 Kxe3 Qxc6 and the rest is elementary. In this game Flohr gained revenge for his loss to Pitschak in the previous game by adopting the technique with which he was defeated. He weakened the pawns around the castled king and then ripped open the defences with a devastating attack. } 0-1

1. e4 { This is one of the best ways to begin what is a race and a struggle: a race to get the pieces out rapidly and onto squares where they can operate most efficiently; a struggle to gain control of the centre. At one stroke the e-pawn takes up an important square in the centre and attacks two others, while the queen and bishop control eight more squares. } 1... e6 { This quietly aggressive move prepares to dispute White’s centre by 2...d5. This defence has the merit of avoiding the many strong openings White can play after the customary 1...e5 reply. } 2. d4 { Of a similar move, Philidor in his Chess Analysed (1791) says, “This Pawn is played two Moves for two very important Reafons: the firft is, to hinder your Adverfary’s King’s Bifhop to play upon your King’s Bifhop’s Pawn; and the fecond, to put the Strength of your Pawns in the Middle of the Exchequer, which is of great Confequence to attain the making of a Queen.” We may ftill follow the advice if not the fpelling. } 2... d5 { An attack on the e-pawn which immediately challenges the centre. } 3. Nc3 { Of the various courses open to White (advancing the e-pawn to e5, exchanging pawns, sacrificing his centre pawn or protecting it) he takes that which enables him to develop a piece and maintain the pressure. } 3... dxe4 { Temporarily allowing White more freedom of action, but Black hopes to play ...c5 later and destroy the troublesome d-pawn. } 4. Nxe4 { The recapture leaves White with a slight edge in his centralized knight and pawn position. } 4... Nd7 { Preparing a support for the g8-knight’s development at f6. If White then exchanges knights, Black can recapture with the d7-knight. If he played instead 4...Nf6 then comes 5 Nxf6+ and Black must either break up his kingside pawns by 5...gxf6 or capture with the queen and risk its being bothered by the minor pieces. A sample of what could happen (after 4...Nf6 5 Nxf6+ Qxf6) is this little trap: 6 Nf3 Bd7 (to seize the long diagonal) 7 Bd3 Bc6 8 Bg5 Bxf3 9 Qd2! Qxd4 10 Bb5+ and White wins the enemy queen. } 5. Nf3 { The best possible way to put the king’s knight to work – by developing it at f3 where it has enormous influence on the centre, and where it stands peerless in defence of the castled king. } 5... Be7 { A noncommittal developing move (it brings a piece off the back rank and helps the king castle quickly) but not so good as the conventional 5...Ngf6 . If Black tries instead the fianchetto development of his c8-bishop (tempting in view of White’s exposed knight), there is a pretty trap he can stumble into: 5...b6 6 Bb5 Bb7 7 Ne5! Bxe4 (or 7...Bc8 8 Bg5 Nf6 9 Nc6, winning the queen) 8 Bxd7+ Ke7 9 Bc6! and Black must lose some material. } 6. Bd3 { This is probably sharper than 6 Bc4 but either move places the bishop in a good spot and clears the first rank for kingside castling. } 6... Ngf6 { Black too prepares to get his king into safety by developing (at long last) his g8-knight. } 7. Qe2 { White develops a piece and supports his central knight strongly with queen and bishop. This is more restraining on Black’s cramped position than 7 Nxf6+ Bxf6, when Black can initiate an attack on White’s centre with ...c5. } 7... O-O { The king seeks security in the corner. There was no easy freeing manoeuvre in 7...Nxe4 8 Bxe4 Nf6 since 9 Bxb7 Bxb7 10 Qb5+ followed by 11 Qxb7 wins a pawn for White. } 8. O-O { White’s castling is less to escape danger than to let the h1-rook take an active part in the game. White’s position is so promising as to offer him a good attacking line in 8 Bg5 Nxe4 9 Qxe4 g6 (certainly not 9...Nf6 to prevent mate, as 10 Bxf6 wins on the spot) 10 h4, when White can castle on the queenside and storm the enemy bastions with his kingside pawns. } 8... Nxe4 { Black exchanges to get some elbow-room. } 9. Qxe4! { Takes command of the board with a threat of mate! Offhand it looks risky to make this capture and leave the queen exposed to harassment by the minor pieces, but Black is in no position (in either sense of the word) to make trouble. He has all he can do to stay alive! } 9... Nf6 { Naturally, Black does not wish to advance one of the kingside pawns, for instance 9...g6, unless compelled to, but what’s wrong with the move he plays, 9...Nf6? Does it not bring the knight to its best square, guard against mate, beat off the queen, and free his own queenside? Indeed it does all these things, and under the circumstances it is probably Black’s best move. It is strange that a move made under duress often does not have the same positive effect as a move made of one’s own volition. } 10. Qh4 { After this, Black’s knight, which to be sure stands on a good square, must remain on that square to guard against mate. } 10... b6 { The c8-bishop, barred by Black’s very first move from coming out to the kingside, seeks other means to take part in the battle. Development at b7 looks attractive, as from there it commands the long diagonal. } 11. Bg5! { Excellent strategy! White attacks the most important defensive piece, the knight that guards against mate. The specific threat is 12 Bxf6 Bxf6 13 Qxh7#. A simple threat and easy to meet – all Black has to do is play 11...g6 or 11...h6. What then is White aiming at? The hidden purpose is to force Black to move one of the kingside pawns, to avoid being mated. A move by either of these pawns creates a looseness in the defensive structure that can never be repaired. It weakens the position organically as it makes a breach that can never be closed. The pawn that advances can never go back to its former position in the line of defensive pawns. } 11... g6 { On the alternative 11...h6 White wins by 12 Bxf6 Bxf6 13 Qe4, when the threat of mate wins the rook on a8, an innocent bystander. } 12. c4 { A very good move! To begin with, it prevents Black playing 12...Nd5, to remove by exchange White’s attacking pieces. Offensively, it prepares an advance of the d4-pawn, which will break up Black’s pawn structure at e6. Once this is done, White’s rook will have a point of entry on the e-file. } 12... Bb7 { Black has no effective counterattack. The best he can do is to keep on developing pieces on the most favourable squares to make a hard fight of it. } 13. d5 { Threatening, after the preparatory 14 Rad1, to take the e6-pawn so that the forced recapture by 15...fxe6 deprives Black’s g-pawn of one of its props. } 13... exd5 { This seems to win a pawn, as should White recapture by 14 cxd5 the reply 14...Nxd5 not only holds on to the pawn but compels an exchange of bishops, taking the edge off White’s attack. } 14. Rfe1! { This unexpected zwischenzug (in-between move) threatens immediate victory by 15 Rxe7 Qxe7 16 Bxf6 Qd6 17 Ng5 h5 18 Qxh5! gxh5 19 Bh7#! } 14... h6 { Black offers a pawn to deflect one of the pieces bearing down so heavily on his f6-knight and e7-bishop. There was no relief in 14...Kg7 to support the knight, as White responds with the brutal 15 Bh6+ winning the exchange. } 15. Qxh6 { But not 15 Bxh6, which permits 15...Ne4 driving off White’s queen. White now plans 16 Bxg6 fxg6 17 Qxg6+ Kh8 18 Nd4 (threatening to win by 19 Ne6, 19 Nf5 or 19 Re3 followed by 20 Rh3+) 18...Qe8 19 Qh6+ Kg8 20 Nf5 Rf7 21 Bxf6 winning easily. } 15... Ng4 { White has a neat win against the defence by 15...Ne4. He plays 16 Bxe7 Qxe7 17 cxd5 (threatening to capture the pinned e4-knight next) 17....Bxd5 18 Bxe4 Bxe4 19 Rxe4! Qxe4 20 Ng5, when Black must lose his queen or be mated. The text-move is of course an attempt to chase the queen away. } 16. Qh4 { White supports the bishop, attacks the knight and threatens to win by 17 Bxe7. What more can be achieved by one move? } 16... Bxg5 { Returning the knight to f6 leads to catastrophe, viz.: 16...Nf6 17 Rxe7 Qxe7 18 Bxf6 and White attacks Black’s queen while threatening 19 Qh8#. } 17. Nxg5 { Once again the theme song – mate at h7. } 17... Nf6 { And Black must dance to the tune, by bringing the knight back to f6. Here too Black posts the knight on a good square, but not of his own free will. } 18. Qh6 { This restricts Black more than would manoeuvring the rook over to h3 by way of e3. For example, after 18 Re3 Re8 19 Rh3 Kf8 the king escapes immediate disaster. After White’s actual move, if Black tries 18...Re8 he falls into 19 Bxg6 Rxe1+ 20 Rxe1 fxg6 21 Qxg6+ Kh8 22 Nf7#. } 18... d4 { To prevent 19 Re3, and to give the bishop more play on the long diagonal. How does White continue the attack? Can he bring up the reserves without losing too much time? Or can he weaken the defensive formation and make it vulnerable to immediate assault? Is there a hint in the last question? Yes, indeed! Black’s chief defence lies in his knight, which guards against the mate at h7, and the f-pawn supporting the all-important g-pawn. If only White could strike at these two defenders – threaten them, remove them, get them out of the way somehow... There is a move, the kind that looks absurd at first glance! Hint No. 2: A master player looks at every move he would like to make, especially the impossible ones. } 19. Re6!! { Threatening to capture the knight, and then mate with the queen. } 19... Re8 { Had Black played 19...fxe6, there would have followed 20 Qxg6+ Kh8 21 Qh6+ Kg8 22 Bh7+ Kh8 23 Bf5+ Kg8 24 Bxe6+ Rf7 25 Bxf7#. It is interesting to note how the startling 19 Re6 move not only threatens to take the knight but also exploits the fact that the f-pawn dare not capture the rook and abandon the defence of the g-pawn. Black’s last move is intended to clear the f8-square for the king, if White should take the knight and then check at h7 with his queen. } 20. Bxg6 { Breaking through the pawn barrier! White’s threat is 21 Bxf7#. There is no defence: 1) 20...fxe6 21 Bf7#. 2) 20...fxg6 21 Qxg6+ Kh8 22 Nf7#. 3) 20...Qd7 21 Bh7+ Nxh7 (or 21...Kh8 22 Qxf6#) 22 Qxh7+ Kf8 23 Qh8#. } 1-0

1. e4 { This is an excellent start toward developing the pieces, as lines are immediately opened for the queen and a bishop. The e-pawn itself helps in the battle for the centre by occupying a key square and attacking two others, d5 and f5. } 1... e6 { In spite of its modest appearance, this move is just as good as the straightforward 1...e5. Black’s idea is to follow up with 2...d5, attacking White’s centre. He is then prepared to meet 3 exd5 by recapturing with the e-pawn, thus maintaining a pawn in the centre. } 2. d4 { Naturally! White puts another pawn in the centre, now making e5 and c5 forbidden territory for Black’s pieces. Meanwhile, his own queen and dark-squared bishop have more freedom of movement. } 2... d5 { Putting the question to the e-pawn! White has a choice of various replies: 1) 3 exd5, in order to simplify. 2) 3 e5, to cramp Black with the pawn chain. 3) 3 Nc3 (also 3 Nd2 or, less effectively, 3 Bd3), to protect the pawn and develop a piece at the same time. The first method was favoured by Morphy, who liked open positions that gave his pieces wide scope for attack. Nowadays it is rarely adopted, as after the exchange of pawns the positions are equal and symmetrical and an attack is difficult to whip up, unless you are a Morphy. The cramping move 3 e5 has a great many advocates, but the argument against this system is that White’s pawn chain is rigid and susceptible to undermining tactics. Black initiates a strong counterattack on the base of the pawn-chain by 3...c5, followed by ...Nc6 and ...Qb6, when White finds himself defending a centre that has lost its flexibility. There remains the third way, which is simple and consistent with common sense in chess – to support the e-pawn and bring a piece out on the scene. } 3. Nc3 { Typical Tarrasch: he selects the method which furthers his development and maintains tension in the centre. This move brings a knight out, protects the e-pawn and increases the pressure on d5. } 3... dxe4 { Tarrasch disapproves of this exchange of pawns, as Black surrenders the centre without obtaining any compensation. If results are a measure of the merit of an opinion, Tarrasch proved his point in this match. Mieses played 3...dxe4 seven times with Black, with the consequence that two games were drawn and five were won by Tarrasch. } 4. Nxe4 { Now White has a beautifully centralized knight, pressure on e5 and c5, and a superior pawn position (a pawn at d4 to one at e6) which assures him greater freedom of action. } 4... Nd7 { Intending to support the g8-knight when it reaches f6. If Black plays 4...Nf6 at once, White can exchange knights by 5 Nxf6+. Black’s recapture either brings his queen too early into the game, or with 5...gxf6 allows his kingside pawn structure to be broken up. } 5. Nf3 { This is where the king’s knight is most useful, so why not place it there at once? Even the greatest masters do not play startling, bizarre or ‘brilliant’ moves in the opening in an effort to be different, or to impress others with their ability to find extraordinary moves in commonplace positions. They are content to develop their pieces quickly, placing them on squares where they will operate to greatest effect, and then wait for Nature to take its course. When the time is ripe for combinative play, the odds are it will turn in favour of the player whose development is superior. } 5... Ngf6 { A sound developing move. Not only does the g8-knight move to the square most suitable for its powers, but it challenges the sovereignty of White’s knight and disputes its hold on the centre. } 6. Bd3 { Rather than retreat, White supports the knight by developing another piece. If Black exchanges on e4, White remains with a piece in the centre. } 6... Be7 { The bishop is well placed at e7, and the decks are cleared for early kingside castling. 6...Nxe4 7 Bxe4 Nf6 8 Bd3 is an interesting alternative, when the time lost by the bishop’s retreat compensates Black for the tempo he lost when he played 3...dxe4. } 7. O-O { The king hides behind a pawn barricade while the rook moves in toward the half-open e-file. } 7... Nxe4 { Black exchanges to free his crowded position and let the queenside pieces get some air. } 8. Bxe4 { The recapture gives White a monopoly on the important squares and poses Black the problem of attaining equality. } 8... Nf6 { This is always a fine square for the knight, and in this case the knight gets there with gain of time by attacking the unprotected bishop. } 9. Bd3 { This mobile bishop is too valuable for White to allow its exchange. Any such transaction benefits Black as a reduction in the number of pieces on the board eases the pressure on him. } 9... b6 { Understandably, Black wants his light-squared bishop on the job and intends developing it at b7. There is danger, though, in attempting this before the king has castled. Not only is there the risk of a check on the a4-e8 diagonal, which might compel the king to move and forfeit his right to castle, but there is also the possibility of White planting a knight on c6, a square weakened by the advance of Black’s b-pawn. } 10. Ne5! { The knight occupies a wonderful outpost and will put a restraining hand on Black’s ambition to expand. } 10... O-O { Black realizes that 10...Bb7 is refuted by 11 Bb5+, to which he must respond either with 11...Kf8 losing the castling privilege, or with 11...c6 giving up a pawn. Naturally, it would be silly to snatch a pawn by 10...Qxd4 and fall into 11 Bb5+, losing the queen by a discovered attack. } 11. Nc6 { Immediately pouncing on the weakened square, with a view to removing Black’s dark-squared bishop. But why give up the knight, which I said a moment ago was occupying a wonderful outpost, for a bishop that seems to have little potential? There are at least three good reasons: The third reason is rather subtle: } 11... Qd6 { As good as any other move the queen can make. } 12. Qf3! { A very important zwischenzug (in-between move). It is stronger than the immediate 12 Nxe7+ and causes Black to modify his plans. Let us analyse both moves: If White plays 12 Nxe7+, then after 12...Qxe7 13 Qf3 White attacks the rook. The rook evades the queen by escaping to b8, and Black’s next move, 14...Bb7, drives the queen off the long diagonal, leaving Black’s bishop in control of it. After the actual move 12 Qf3, Black is threatened with 13 Nxe7+ Qxe7 14 Qxa8 – loss of a rook. This time the rook cannot run from the queen, as the flight square b8 is covered by White’s knight, and the response 12...Bb7 (to interpose the bishop, meanwhile developing it on the long diagonal) fails after 13 Nxe7+ Qxe7 14 Qxb7, and White wins a piece. } 12... Bd7 { The upshot of all this is that in order to save the rook’s life the bishop must be content to move to d7, where it has little scope. } 13. Nxe7+ { Strategically, this represents a triumph for White. Not only does he remain with the advantage of the two bishops against Black’s knight and bishop, but he has also compelled Black’s remaining bishop to take up an unfavourable post, while White retains control of the long light-squared diagonal. } 13... Qxe7 { Black recaptures with the impression that his position is solid enough, though defensive in character. } 14. Bg5 { White puts paralysing pressure on the knight with this powerful pin. Before going any further, let’s review the bidding: By doing nothing more remarkable than making simple developing moves, White has an advantage in his pair of bishops, a better all-around position, more pieces in play, and an enduring initiative. More pieces in play? Yes, his queen and both bishops are actively posted, while Black’s knight is unable to move, his queen must hover about the knight (or lose a pawn after Bxf6) and his bishop has little mobility, shut off as it is from the kingside by Black’s own e-pawn. The pawn position in the centre also favours White, in that his d-pawn on the fourth rank has more to say about affairs than the enemy pawn at e6. White now plans to create a breach in the line-up of pawns screening Black’s king, by next playing the surprising but logical 15 Qe4. Black could not reply 15...Nxe4 to this, as after 16 Bxe7 (attacking two pieces) 16...Re8 17 Bxe4 he has no time to take the e7-bishop as his a8-rook is under attack. The idea underlying 15 Qe4 is not to induce Black to snatch the queen, but by the threat of 16 Bxf6 Qxf6 17 Qxh7# to compel him to play 15...g6. The effect of this pawn move would be to loosen the defensive structure shielding the king, remove a prop from under the pinned knight, and offer White points of entry on the weakened dark squares h6 and f6, which are no longer guarded by the g-pawn. One possibility, for example, is 15 Qe4 g6 16 Qh4 (attacking the knight) 16...Kg7 17 Bh6+, and White wins the exchange. } 14... Rac8 { Black shifts the rook from the line of fire, so that 15 Qe4 Nxe4 16 Bxe7 Rfe8 retains material equality. Constructively, Black intends to follow up with 15...c5, coming to grips with White’s centre pawn and opening the c-file for his rook. } 15. Rfe1 { A useful developing, restraining and preparatory move: } 15... Rfe8 { Vacating a square for the king. Black abandons the projected 15...c5, against which Tarrasch intended (according to his own comments) 16 Qh3 (threatening 17 Bxf6) 16...h6 17 Bxh6 and now: 1) 17...c4 18 Bxg7 Kxg7 19 Qg3+ Kh8 20 Qh4+ Kg7 21 Qg5+ Kh8 22 Qh6+ (pretty zigzagging by the queen!) 22...Kg8 23 Re5 with a quick mate. 2) 17...gxh6 18 Qxh6 cxd4 (to meet 19 Re5 with 19...Rc5) 19 Qg5+ Kh8 20 Re4 and Black must give up his queen to avoid mate. } 16. Qh3! { The winning move - although it appears that White has been playing a long string of winning moves. The pressure is now redoubled on the h-pawn, which White threatens to win either by 17 Bxf6 followed by 18 Qxh7+ or simply by taking it at once with the bishop, as Black’s pinned knight dare not recapture, and his king may not take the bishop. How does Black defend himself against White’s threats? If 16...h6, then 17 Bxh6 gxh6 18 Qxh6 Qf8 (otherwise 19 Re5 will lead to mate) 19 Qxf6, when White, two pawns up, wins easily. If 16...g6 (saving the h-pawn but depriving the knight of any real support), White wins by 17 Qh4 Kg7 18 Re4!, followed by 19 Rf4, and the rook too hits out at the helpless knight. If 16...e5 (uncovering an attack on the queen), then 17 Bxf6 Bxh3 (or 17...Qxf6 18 Qxd7, and White wins a piece) 18 Bxe7 and White is a piece ahead. Finally, after 16...c5 17 Bxh7+ Kf8 18 Be4 (threatening a devastating check at h8) 18...Kg8, Black is a pawn down and still on the defensive. All these variations are pleasant – especially if you are on the winning side! } 16... Qd6 { Hoping that 17 Bxf6 gxf6 18 Qxh7+, winning a pawn, will appease White. } 17. Bxf6 { White removes the only defender in the neighbourhood of the black king, and... } 17... gxf6 { ...uproots the g-pawn, exposing the king. } 18. Qh6! { Holding the king fast! The idea is to keep him from escaping by way of f8 while facing him with deadly threats. The modus operandi after the text-move is 19 Bxh7+! Kh8 20 Bg6+ Kg8 21 Qh7+ Kf8 22 Qxf7#. If you can play this sort of move (18 Qh6), you are a cut above the average player. Most young players (in a chess sense) have a tendency to try checking the king to death only to find after something like 18 Qxh7+ Kf8 19 Qh8+ Ke7 that the king has escaped and the attack is exhausted. What is worse is that White’s queen and d-pawn are threatened, and that saving both by 20 Qh4 lets Black respond with 20...Rh8 and suddenly White is thrown on the defensive! } 18... f5 { Intercepting the bishop’s line of attack. } 19. Re3 { Obviously threatening check at g3, which would force Black to give up his queen in order to avoid instant mate. Notice how the occupation of the partly open e-file by the rook enables the convenient use of e3 as a transfer point, allowing the rook to switch over to the open files on the kingside. } 19... Qxd4 { Guarding the g7-square, so that after 20 Rg3+ Kh8, White has no check there with his queen. If instead 19...f6, to try escaping with the king, then 20 Rg3+ Kf7 21 Qg7# is mate. Or if 19...Kh8, then 20 Rh3 forces 20...Kg8, when 21 Rg3+ is fatal. } 20. c3! { A beautiful coup de repos! Black is helpless: his queen dare not leave the diagonal leading to g7, and 20...Qg7 21 Rg3 pins the queen, while 20...Qh8 succumbs to 21 Rg3+, and the poor king’s only flight square is occupied by his queen! This game was awarded a brilliancy prize. } 1-0

1. e4 { With his first move, White gets a foothold in the centre and enables the development of his kingside pieces. } 1... e5 { Black must also establish a pawn in the centre, while preventing 2 d4 from being freely played. What if White does continue 2 d4? After 2...exd4 3 Qxd4 Nc6 4 Qe3 Nf6 5 Nc3 Bb4 Black has three pieces in play with easy development. It is true that White has a pawn in the centre, but it will need constant care, and his queen meanwhile has lost valuable time. In short, after 1...e5 White may respond 2 d4 but not to advantage. } 2. Nf3 { The knight is posted without delay on its most effective square in the opening. The move is ideal, as the knight develops with a threat. This limits the opponent’s choice of replies, since he must do something to meet the threat before going about his business. } 2... Nc6 { The best way to protect the pawn. The knight’s development is natural, and no time is lost meeting the threat. } 3. Bb5 { The strongest move on the board here, this characterizes the Ruy Lopez, the most powerful of kingside openings. As Reuben Fine puts it, “One reason why the Ruy Lopez is so strong is that the most natural sequence of moves leads to an ideal position for White.” } 3... Nf6 { Black brings his g8-knight out toward the centre with an attack on the e4-pawn. Lasker favoured the knight’s development at this point, but modern theory inclines to interpolating 3...a6 first, to make the bishop declare its intentions, and in any case to dislodge it from its fine position. } 4. O-O { Very much to the point: the king is whisked away into safety while the h1-rook is activated. } 4... Nxe4 { Should Black capture this pawn? Lasker’s view was: “When you are conscious not to have violated the rules laid down, you should accept the sacrifice of an important central pawn. If you do not, as a rule, the pawn which you have rejected will become very troublesome to you.” } 5. d4 { This is stronger than 5 Re1. Black’s e-pawn is doubly attacked, while lines are opened up for White’s queen and dark-squared bishop. } 5... Nd6 { Puts the question to the bishop, which apparently must capture the knight or retreat. An alternative course was 5...Be7, developing another piece instead of moving the same one twice. Black must not waste time holding on to the extra pawn but should continue bringing pieces into play. } 6. dxe5! { Initiating an attack which is troublesome to meet. White temporarily offers a piece, but he can be sure of regaining it quickly. This is superior to the less dynamic 6 Ba4, which gives Black time to reply 6...e4 with good counterplay. } 6... Nxb5 { The knight’s excursion has cost Black valuable time, as the knight has made four moves to capture a bishop that has only moved once. } 7. a4 { White attacks the knight at once to recover the piece he lost. } 7... Nd6 { A fifth move by the same knight! White will surely have a strong attack in return for the pawn he intends to sacrifice. Black should have played 7...Nbd4 8 Nxd4 Nxd4 9 Qxd4 d5, a better way of returning the piece as it frees his bishops. } 8. exd6 { White’s first dividend comes in the form of an open centre file leading straight to Black’s king! } 8... Bxd6 { Not a happy recapture, as the d-pawn is blocked, but certainly better than taking with the pawn, when Black’s position is even more awkward. } 9. Ng5! { This move is superior to the natural 9 Re1+. It is, as we shall see, both energetic and subtle. One finesse is directed against Black’s castling. After 9...O-O, White would play 10 Qd3 threatening 11 Qxh7#. Black would be forced to reply 10...g6 (not 10...f5 11 Qd5+ Kh8 12 Nf7+, winning the exchange) and weaken the defensive formation of pawns. Once the line of pawns is disturbed, the king is vulnerable to direct attack. } 9... Be7 { An interesting move. In its retreat, the bishop not only attacks the knight but also manages to unblock the d-pawn. Black hopes either to force the knight to leave or to bring about an exchange of pieces, ridding himself of the attacking knight. } 10. Qh5! { En avant! The obvious threat of mate camouflages the real purpose of this move. White’s last two moves are those of a beginner – or perhaps of a great master! The knight has moved twice to assist the queen in an attack, which the books say is premature, since White’s development is not complete. Why does Alekhine violate elementary opening principles? The reason he does so is that routine development (“You get your pieces out quietly and I’ll do the same with mine”) would give Black time to reorganize his position. Black has committed some indiscretions (such as moving one knight five times in the opening!), and the way to punish these lapses is to keep him occupied – face him with problems at every point and give him no time to recover. If it requires unconventional moves to force weaknesses in his position, then play these unorthodox moves! Moves are good or bad by one standard only – their effect on the position at hand. } 10... g6 { What other choice was there? If Black castles in order to avoid 11 Qxf7#, he falls into 11 Qxh7#, or if he exchanges by 10...Bxg5 then 11 Bxg5 forces 11...Ne7, when the pin 12 Re1 wins a piece – as a start! } 11. Qh6! { White anchors the queen on this square, which is no longer guarded by Black’s g-pawn, as the first step in controlling the dark squares. White now threatens to penetrate further into the heart of the position by 12 Qg7, attacking the rook. This would force 12...Rf8 in reply, when 13 Nxh7 wins the exchange, a rook for a knight. } 11... Bf8 { Not only must further invasion be prevented, but the queen must be driven back. Black has little choice, as castling is against the law, while 11...Bxg5 loses to 12 Bxg5 f6 13 Qg7 Rf8 14 Re1+ Ne7 15 Bh6 Rf7 16 Qg8+ Rf8 17 Qxf8#. } 12. Re1+ { Forcing Black to tie himself up in knots. } 12... Ne7 { Certainly not 12....Be7, when 13 Qg7 Rf8 14 Nxh7 (threatening 15 Qxf8#) 14...d5 15 Nf6# is mate. At this point, in spite of White’s disregard of conventional methods of development, he has three pieces in active play, while Black has none! Black does have one piece off the first rank, but it is held fast by a pin and unable to move. } 13. Ne4! { Threatening to deliver mate on the move! } 13... f5 { The only move to stay on the board! If Black continues 13...Bxh6 White wins by 14 Nf6+ Kf8 15 Bxh6#, or if 13...Nf5 with a double attack on the queen, White retaliates with 14 Nf6# – double check and mate! } 14. Nf6+ { One way to get at the king is to make him come out into the open. } 14... Kf7 { Moving the king forfeits the privilege of castling, but unfortunately it’s Black’s only move. } 15. Qh4 { White’s queen and knight were both attacked, so the queen moves where she protects the knight. } 15... Bg7 { Now threatening 16...Bxf6. The alternative attack by 15...Ng8 pins the knight and strikes at it with two pieces, but is refuted by 16 Qc4+ Kxf6 (or 16...Kg7 17 Ne8+ and Black must give up his queen) 17 Qh4+ and White wins the queen. } 16. Bg5 { Protecting the knight, which had no flight square. } 16... h6 { Threatening the knight again by hitting out at one of its defenders. If 16...Ng8 instead, White has a pretty combination in 17 Nxg8 Qxg8 18 Re7+ Kf8 19 Bh6 followed by 20 Qf6+, forcing mate. Or he may prefer to win by 17 Qc4+ d5 18 Nxd5 Qxg5 19 Nxc7+ Kf6 20 Ne8#. } 17. Qc4+! { A happy diversion, as the check compels the opponent to drop everything and save his king. } 17... Kf8 { Practically forced, as 17...d5 18 Nxd5 Qxd5 19 Rxe7+ costs Black his queen. } 18. Rxe7! { The hallmark of an Alekhine combination is the kick at the end of a series of apparently innocuous moves. White’s threat is obvious: mate on the move. } 18... Qxe7 { On 18...Kxe7, the only other way of preventing mate at f7, White replies 19 Nd5++, and wins the queen next move. } 19. Nh7+ { Direct attack on the king and discovered attack on the queen. } 19... Rxh7 { Black takes all the material he can get for his queen. } 20. Bxe7+ { The point of the combination: in return for his rook and bishop, White gets the queen – and a lasting initiative! } 20... Kxe7 { Black must take the bishop. } 21. Qxc7 { White could win more simply by 21 Qg8 Kf6 22 Qxh7 Kf7 23 Nc3 d6 24 Re1, followed by 25 Re7+, but the text-move is good enough. The queen remains active while Black’s queenside is immobilized. } 21... Bxb2 { Black makes trouble. He takes a pawn and attacks the rook. } 22. Ra2 { The rook steps aside nimbly and turns on his attacker. } 22... Bf6 { The bishop retreats to (comparative) safety. } 23. c4! { Clears the way for the rook, which now can get to the open e-file – and the king! } 23... Kf7 { The king flees from the line of fire. Black hopes to free himself by 24...Rh8 and 25....Bd8, driving the queen off, followed by the advance of his d-pawn to release his queenside pieces. } 24. Re2 { White seizes the open file. Controlling it gives the rook a clear road and access to the enemy camp. } 24... Rh8 { Black intends either to evict the queen by 25...Bd8 or to dispute ownership of the e-file by 25...Re8. } 25. Qd6! { Nailing down the d-pawn and paralysing Black’s forces on the queenside. } 25... a5 { What else is there? 25...Re8 26 Rxe8 Kxe8 27 Qxf6 wins a piece, or if 25...b6, then 26 Qd5+ catches the a8-rook. Black’s idea is to follow up with 26...Ra6, dislodging the queen and getting his queenside pieces rolling. } 26. Nc3! { Excellent! White brings another piece up to join in the attack. Notice how the master player selects the move he would like to make, sees that it can’t be made (here the knight is left en prise ) and then makes the move! } 26... Ra6 { Black does not grab the knight with 26....Bxc3, as White mates by 27 Re7+ Kf8 (or 27...Kg8 28 Qd5+ and mate next move) 28 Rxd7+ Kg8 29 Qd5+ Kf8 30 Qf7#. } 27. Qd5+ { White’s queen must retreat from the rook’s attack, but she gains time by checking. } 27... Kg7 { Or 27...Kf8 28 Nb5 (threatening 29 Nd6) 28...Re6 29 Rxe6 dxe6 30 Qc5+ Kg7 31 Qc7+ and a bishop falls with check. } 28. Nb5 { Ready to switch over to d6 in order to support the queen in a mate threat at f7. } 28... Re6 { Otherwise the knight goes to d6 and cuts the rook off from participating in the defence. } 29. Nd6! { The knight goes there anyway, settling down on this fine outpost where it will either take a hand in a decisive combination or simply stay there and choke Black to death. } 29... Rd8 { Naturally, 29...Rxe2 is unthinkable, as 30 Qf7# would come in a flash. } 30. Kf1 { White protects the rook and declares his intention of winning by 31 Nxc8 Rxc8 32 Qxd7+, followed by taking a rook or two. There is no fight left. } 1-0

1. d4 { One of the merits of beginning a game with 1 d4 is that the pawn standing in the centre is protected. It is safe from attack, whereas in openings starting with 1 e4, the e-pawn is more vulnerable. In queen’s pawn openings, with the queen firmly backing up the centre pawn, White dictates the tempo. He has the initiative and keeps it for a long time against any defence, any line of play that Black may select. Right from the start, White is given the opportunity to build up his position, with little danger of being bothered by a counterattack, while Black struggles to achieve equality. If Black plays timidly – if he fails to dispute the centre by ...c5 at some stage – his queenside pieces, especially the c8-bishop, will be badly cramped and unable to develop decent activity. If he develops carelessly – moving the same piece several times in the opening or bringing his bishops out before the knights – punishment will come swiftly. The purpose of chess being to win, not to entertain the gallery with pretty pictures on the chessboard, it is no wonder that many players prefer the ‘dull, safe Queen’s Gambit’ to the romantic but risky adventures of the kingside gambits. I venture to say (and this opinion has forty years of research behind it) that the queen’s pawn openings have contributed as many masterpieces and as many genuine brilliancies as did any of the kingside openings. } 1... d5 { This is the best way for Black to stabilize the pressure in the centre. Each side now has a pawn firmly stationed in the middle of the board, occupying one square and attacking two others; each side has released two pieces for action. } 2. c4 { The object of this move is to destroy Black’s pawn-centre. First, White offers a pawn to induce Black to surrender the centre. If that does not work, White threatens to dissolve it by 3 cxd5 Qxd5 4 Nc3 Qa5 5 e4, and White controls most of the centre. } 2... dxc4 { Black’s idea with this capture is to avoid the constricted positions that are normally his lot in the Queen’s Gambit Declined, but in doing so he has given up a beautifully centralized pawn for a less central one. Accepting the gambit is perfectly sound, but the resulting play requires great care on Black’s part. Above all, he must not hold on to the extra pawn for too long. } 3. e3 { A good move, but more to the point is 3 Nf3 to prevent the counterthrust 3...e5. White plays to release his light-square bishop and recover the pawn at once. } 3... Bf5 { By this, Black hopes to solve the problem of the shut-in c8-bishop, one of the evils the defence is heir to. However, the solution is not quite so simple! The bishop’s absence from the queenside weakens that section of the board and leaves the b-pawn vulnerable. Another drawback in Black’s move is that it violates one of the precepts for sound development: Bring out your knights before the bishops! Instead of the text-move, Black’s best bet is in counterattack, viz.: 3...e5 4 Bxc4 (or 4 dxe5 Qxd1+ 5 Kxd1 Be6) 4...exd4 5 exd4 Bb4+. Attempting to hold on to the extra pawn might lead Black into one of the traps prepared for the greedy: 3...b5 4 a4 c6 5 axb5 cxb5 6 Qf3, and White wins a piece. } 4. Bxc4 { The recovery of the pawn equalizes the material, but White’s position is slightly superior. } 4... e6 { A pawn move that contributes to the development of a piece, in this case the f8-bishop, is always in order. Developing one of the knights first is somewhat risky. For instance, 4...Nf6 5 Qb3 threatens to win a pawn by 6 Qxb7 or 6 Bxf7+, or if 4...Nc6 5 Qb3 Na5, then 6 Bxf7+ Kd7 7 Qd5+ Kc8 8 Qxf5+ Kb8 9 Qxa5, and White wins two pieces. Even at this early stage White is directing events. } 5. Qb3 { Why does White move his queen instead of getting his knights out? His purpose is to punish Black for faulty development. Black’s play has not been normal procedure, and the way to take advantage of his sins is not with routine moves. White’s move, developing a piece with a threat (6 Qxb7) keeps Black on the run. It does not give him time to consolidate his position. } 5... Be4 { This looks attractive, since Black protects his b-pawn, and at the same time threatens to play 6...Bxg2, winning a rook. Black’s move, however, is abnormal and a serious infraction of the opening principle which states: Move each piece only once in the opening; place it at once on the square where it exerts most power and where it has the greatest freedom of movement. } 6. f3 { This move is justified on more than one count. Not only does it parry a threat in an economical way, but it also forces Black to lose a move in the retreat of his bishop. Incidentally, the pawn at f3 will firmly support a later advance of the e3-pawn. } 6... Bc6 { Now we see the results of the bishop’s ill-timed expedition. It stands at c6, depriving the b8-knight of its natural square of development in the opening. Worse yet, it obstructs the c-pawn. If this pawn cannot get to c5 to dispute control of the centre and to open the c-file for Black’s pieces, there is a danger that Black will be smothered. } 7. Ne2 { “But the knight belongs on f3!” you must be protesting. So it does, but if it cannot develop at f3, get it into the game somehow! Move it, if only to get it off the back rank! Of course, the same comment applies to the other three knights, too. White is ready to castle and get the h1-rook working. } 7... Nf6 { At last, a normal, reasonable developing move to which no exception can be taken! In nearly every variation of every opening, the king’s knight does its job most effectively at f6 (or f3 for White). } 8. e4 { This move has a threefold purpose: 1) to control the centre, by occupying it with pawns; 2) to clear a path for the development of his c1-bishop; 3) to limit further the activities of Black’s c6-bishop. } 8... Be7 { The only square open to the bishop. If instead 8...Bd6, the reply 9 e5 wins a piece for White. The back rank is cleared and Black is ready to castle – if White lets him! } 9. Nbc3 { Bringing another piece into play with gain of tempo. The threat is 10 d5 exd5 11 exd5 Bd7 12 Qxb7, and White wins a piece. } 9... Qc8 { Black must guard the b-pawn and put aside any thought of castling for a while. } 10. d5 { In order to drive the bishop back to the second rank. } 10... exd5 { This exchange of pawns is inferior to simply retreating the bishop. The opening up of lines favours the side that is better developed, and in this case White will benefit. } 11. exd5 { This recapture opens the e-file for the use of White’s major pieces and compels Black’s bishop on c6 to retreat. } 11... Bd7 { Anything else loses material. Before making his next move, White must decide whether to continue bringing pieces into play or to try exploiting his present lead in development. Thus, he pauses to take stock before committing himself to a definite course of action. He has a pawn stationed at d5, which at first glance is doing an excellent job. It prevents Black’s b8-knight from developing at c6, keeps the d7-bishop from coming to e6, and restrains the f6-knight. The pawn does this single-handed, but at a price! In standing at d5 it occupies a square that should be reserved for pieces. Pieces have more mobility than pawns and can attack more readily. Pieces can utilize d5 as a jumping-off square, a point of departure to any part of the board. In fact, the wretched pawn does a disservice in obstructing the diagonal of the bishop and the supporting queen and takes up room on a file which should be open! Better that the d5-square be vacant than that a pawn block traffic there! (And in this last sentence, as we shall see, is the key to White’s problem). What about Black’s prospects? With the exception of the f6-knight, his pieces are confined to the first two ranks. His position is a bit crowded, but if he gets a chance to castle and reorganize his forces, it will be hard to subdue him. White must not allow him time to do this. White must not dawdle! } 12. d6! { This energetic thrust opens the diagonal leading to Black’s tender spot, the f7-pawn, clears the d-file for later exploitation by a rook, and vacates the strategically important d5-square for the use of a piece. Meanwhile, the attack on Black’s bishop leaves him no time to breathe! } 12... Bxd6 { Better than 12...cxd6 hemming the bishop in. } 13. Bxf7+ { This will smoke the king out! Once the king moves and loses the privilege of castling, he stands on insecure ground to the end of his days (which may not be far off). } 13... Kd8 { Black prefers this to 13...Kf8 imprisoning the h8-rook. } 14. Bg5 { This pin paralyses Black’s most useful piece. Meanwhile – and this sums up the miserable state of his game – Black’s mighty queen is smothered by his own pieces! } 14... Nc6 { Black’s idea is to develop a piece and give the queen and a8-rook freedom to move – if only to the next square! It is hard to suggest a better move, as every move is inadequate in a losing position. Black might have ventured on a more active defence, such as 14...Be8 followed by 15...Rf8, 15...Qd7 or 15...Qf5. He must try to beat back White’s attacking pieces or get rid of them by exchanges. The formula in such cases is: In a cramped position try to relieve the pressure by forcing exchanges of pieces. } 15. Ne4 { White puts more strain on the pinned knight. The threat (and there always is a threat when a pinned piece is attacked more than once) is 16 Nxf6 gxf6 17 Bxf6+, and White wins a rook. } 15... Be7 { Protecting the knight once again, and at the same time unpinning it. This is a better defence than 15...Be5, which helps guard the knight but does nothing to relieve the pin. In such situations, the extra defender itself may be on shaky ground and apt to be disturbed. For instance, after 15...Be5 16 f4 Bd4 17 Nxd4 (removing one of the knight’s protectors) 17...Nxd4 18 Qc3 Black is embarrassed for a plausible continuation. } 16. Bxf6 { White does well to remove this rock of defence. } 16... gxf6 { Black takes with the pawn, as he wants to keep both his bishops. With his king so well sheltered by pieces, it looks difficult to penetrate Black’s barricades. } 17. O-O-O! { Much more energetic than castling on the other side. White’s king is somewhat exposed, but as compensation his a1-rook has an instant and powerful grip on the open d-file, putting particular pressure on the unfortunate bishop, which now is pinned. The manoeuvre of castling on the queenside gains a tempo for the attack, while White’s king is in little danger, since Black’s development is so backward. White threatens 18 Be6 or 18 Qe6, either of which adds pressure to the pin. } 17... Ne5 { Not only to help the bishop but also to play 18...Nxf7, removing one of his tormentors. } 18. Nf4 { Threatening sudden death by 19 Ne6#. } 18... Qb8 { An unhappy situation for Black’s queen, but the king needs a flight square. What else was there? If 18...Bf8 to free the e7-square for the king, then 19 Qe6 (threatening 20 Qe8#) 19...Be7 20 Qxe5! fxe5 21 Ne6# mates neatly. } 19. Qe6 { With the queen’s entrance into the enemy camp, the attack gains momentum. White plans a win by 20 Nxf6 (striking once more at the hapless bishop and threatening 21 Rxd7+ and quick mate) 20...Bxf6 21 Qxf6+ Kc8 22 Qxh8+ and mate next move. } 19... Rf8 { Hoping to scare off the bishop, when his f-pawn would be protected by the rook. The alternative 19...Qc8 runs into 20 Qxe5 and the previous win. } 20. Nxf6 { Isn’t it remarkable how threats are summoned up as if by magic against a piece that is pinned? } 20... Bd6 { Interfering with the rook’s action on the open file and thereby threatening to take the queen. Other defences promise no favourable results: 1) 20...Rxf7 21 Rxd7+ and mate in two. 2) 20...Bxf6 21 Qxf6+ Kc8 22 Qxe5 Rxf7 23 Qh8+. 3) 20...Qc8 21 Qxe5 Rxf7 22 Ne6#. With the text, Black unpins his d7-bishop, guards the e5-knight, attacks the queen and threatens the f7-bishop. } 21. Nxd7 { This one hurts a bit. The knight captures one piece and attacks three others. } 21... Nxd7 { Black recaptures and disposes of a troublesome piece. } 22. Rhe1 { The doubling of heavy pieces on the open e-file, with the consequent threat of 23 Qe8+ Rxe8 24 Rxe8#, is enough to break anyone’s spirit. The c-pawn cannot move to give the king room because of the reply 23 Rxd6, and if 22...Nc5, then 23 Qe7+ Kc8 24 Qxf8+ Qxf8 25 Re8# is the finishing touch. } 1-0
