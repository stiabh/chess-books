[Event "The Queen's Pawn Opening"]
{
At some time in his life, almost every chess player makes a happy discovery – the Queen’s Pawn Opening.

The Queen’s Pawn offers White a great many advantages, and all of them can be summed up in one word – pressure!

White gets opportunities to control and exert pressure on the c-file, and in particular on the c5-square. So powerful can it be as to cause, by itself, the collapse of Black’s game.

Against its dire effects there is only one antidote: the advance ...c5, which Black *must*  get in, sooner or later. Without it, he may be choked to death; with it, he frees his position on the queenside, establishes a state of tension in the centre, and can put up a fight for possession of the c-file.

The game Pillsbury-Mason (No. 17) is a classic example of White controlling the c-file, while Black fails to free himself by ...c5. Pillsbury fixes the c-pawn so it dare not move, and then proceeds to attack it with more pieces than Black can summon to its defence. The pawn falls, of course, and White’s continuing control of the vital c-file, extending into the ending, makes the winning process look easy.

In Noteboom-Doesburgh (No. 18), neglect of the freeing manoeuvre ...c5 allows White to restrain and prevent forever the advance of the c-pawn. Eventually, the pawn is nailed down so that Black’s queenside is held in an iron grip. The weaknesses on the queenside lead to collapse on the kingside.

Similar difficulties beset Black in Grünfeld-Schenkein (No. 19), where delay in challenging the centre leads to a sealing in of Black’s c-pawn, and with it his queenside, by an unprotected pawn! White’s sudden shifting of the attack to the kingside leaves Black helpless to resist.

Positional play on a grand scale is seen in the Rubinstein-Salwe (No. 20) game. This again shows the consequences of Black’s omission of the key defensive move in this opening, namely ...c5. White’s control of the c-file and the c5-square enables him to demonstrate a remarkable bit of strategy. He blockades c5 with a bishop (stopping Black’s c-pawn dead in its tracks) and then switches blockaders about, so that this square is occupied in turn by a bishop, a knight, a rook and the queen! Rubinstein eventually captures the c-pawn that was marked for doom and swings into the final movement, a triumphal march of his own passed pawn.

In the Chernev-Hahlbohm (No. 21) game, Black gets in the important counterthrust ...c5, but his centre, with an unprotected knight at d5, lacks solidity. Chernev gains time for his attack by threats against Black’s exposed pieces, and it is these gains of tempo that lend the game its interest. 

Pillsbury-Marco (No. 22) is an ideal Queen’s Gambit game. In it, we see the classic demonstration of what came to be known as the Pillsbury Attack. It is a beautiful example of the power of a knight outpost at e5, and the impetus it furnishes to a whirlwind kingside attack.

In the game between Van Vliet and Znosko-Borovsky (No. 23), it is Black who wrests control of the c-file by a counterattack at the second move with 2...c5. It leads to more advantages, culminating in a rook invasion of the seventh rank and the establishment of a knight outpost at e4. Eventually, Black doubles rooks on the c-file and manoeuvres his king in among the enemy pawns. This leads to his winning a pawn, and the rest is a delightful little lesson in the art of simplification.

1. d4 { White opens with one of the strongest possible first moves: } 1... d5 { Black equalizes the pressure in the centre, prevents White from continuing with 2 e4, and also releases two of his own pieces for action. } 2. c4 { This is a threat and an offer! The threat, a positional one, is 3 cxd5, when after the recapture 3...Qxd5, 4 Nc3 drives the queen off and leaves White dominating the centre. The offer of a pawn has as its purpose the removal of Black’s d-pawn from its fine position in the centre. This offer, unlike the one in the King’s Gambit, involves no risk. White regains the pawn easily and retains an advantage. It is in effect an exchange of a flank pawn for Black’s centre pawn. The point of playing 2 c4 so soon is that it disputes the centre at once, without endangering the safety of the king. There is also another purpose – a strategic one. An exchange of pawns must come, sooner or later, resulting in the opening of the c-file. Ownership of this file is of paramount importance in the Queen ’s Gambit. White generally tries to get full possession of it by posting his queen at c2, and developing his queen’s rook at c1. Control of this file and of the c5-square on this file is equivalent to control of the game. Of such peculiar significance is this c5-square that it is almost enough simply to plant a piece securely there to get a paralysing grip on Black’s game. } 2... e6 { Black defends the centre pawn by supporting it with another pawn. He does not care to capture by 2...dxc4 as that means surrendering the centre to gain a pawn which he cannot hold on to. White, in reply to this, would play 3 Nf3 (to prevent 3...e5), follow up with 4 e3, and then get the pawn back by 5 Bxc4, with a central superiority. Defending the d-pawn by 2...Nf6 is weak. White would play in response 3 cxd5, and Black would have to recapture with a piece. On 3...Qxd5, 4 Nc3 banishes the queen from the centre and costs Black time, while 3...Nxd5 lets White seize the centre with 4 e4 and evict the knight in the process. After the actual move, Black is set to meet 3 cxd5 by 3...exd5, keeping his hold on the centre by maintaining a pawn there. } 3. Nc3 { This is a commendable developing move, as it settles a minor piece on its most suitable square without loss of time. The knight bears down on the e4-square and adds its pressure to that of the c-pawn in the attack on d5. } 3... Nf6 { This knight carries out his part of Black’s opening strategy by simply leaving the back rank. Naturally, his development is toward the centre, where he counteracts the influence of White’s knight on two of the important squares there. } 4. Bg5 { A highly efficient move as it combines rapid development of a piece with a threat. This latter consists of 5 cxd5 exd5 6 Bxf6 gxf6 (or 6...Qxf6 7 Nxd5, and White wins a pawn) and Black’s kingside pawn position is shattered. The opening thus far had been given sporadic earlier trials by various players, but Pillsbury was the first to appreciate its enormous winning possibilities. He pictured the bishop move (most masters brought the bishop quietly into the game at f4) as a sort of Ruy Lopez on the other side of the board! With this particular sequence of moves, which he perfected and popularized, he achieved some remarkable victories, notably in his debut at the Hastings 1895 tournament. In this game, we see him applying the great power of the Queen’s Gambit to crush an opponent who is not familiar with its fine points and who puts up less than flawless defence. He beats Mason ‘like a child’, as Marshall used to express it. } 4... Be7 { If nothing else, the development of the bishop anywhere furthers Black’s progress, as the decks are cleared for kingside castling. At e7, the bishop is happily placed for defence, and, if the need arises, can be transferred quickly to a more aggressive position. Incidentally, the knight is unpinned and White’s threat nullified. } 5. Nf3 { In queen’s pawn openings the king’s knight’s job is the control and sometimes the occupation of the outpost e5. In fact, entrenching the knight at this square and supporting it solidly with the d-pawn and the f-pawn is the motif of what later came to be known as the Pillsbury Attack, a tremendously effective assault on the kingside. } 5... b6 { At first glance, this seems to be a simple and natural way to develop the c8-bishop, as it is hemmed in on the other side by the e-pawn. It took many years, and a great many losses by Black, to discover that an early fianchetto of the bishop was not an easy solution to the problem of the bishop’s development. After a great deal of trial and error, a reasonable defence was hit upon, which consisted of playing ...dxc4 at an early stage, followed after suitable preparation by an attack on White’s d-pawn by ...c5 or ...e5. The first of these moves (...c5) is intended to dispute control of the centre, open the c-file for the use of Black’s pieces and in general free his cramped position. The attack by ...e5 is meant to take away the control of e5 from White’s d-pawn, and to open a diagonal for Black’s c8-bishop. In short, Black first puts up a fight for the centre before he thinks of developing the bishop. It is of almost vital importance that Black play ...c5 sooner or later. This move strikes at White’s d-pawn, establishes tension in the centre, opens the c-file for his own major pieces and frees the crowded position on the queenside. Failure to make this move permits White to seize control of the c-file and the c5-square. Should White manage to post a piece on that square, it will exert terrific pressure on Black’s entire position, and this one factor alone may be enough to cause Black’s downfall. } 6. e3 { White strengthens his centre and clears a path for his f1-bishop. } 6... Bb7 { Black completes the fianchetto development of the c8-bishop. } 7. Rc1 { The rook hurries over to the important c-file. This is only partly open now, but an exchange of pawns will clear the file and accentuate the rook’s power along its whole length. } 7... dxc4 { Black usually waits until White moves his f1-bishop before making this capture, as then the bishop loses a move in recapturing. Apparently Black is anxious to give his b7-bishop more scope on the long central diagonal. } 8. Bxc4 { White recaptures the pawn and gets another piece into play. } 8... Nbd7! { This disposition of the knight is characteristic in queen’s pawn openings. The knight must not go to c6, blocking the c-pawn. The pawn must be free to advance and challenge the centre. At d7, the knight is situated ideally: it supports an advance by ...c5 or ...e5, attacking the centre, it participates in the fight for possession of these squares, and it cooperates with the knight on f6. } 9. O-O { The king disappears from the scene while the rook is made available for duty. } 9... O-O { The advantage of castling is that the king is safer in the corner, where he is sheltered by three pawns and a stalwart knight, than in the centre of the board, while the rook is brought toward the centre files in the most convenient way possible. } 10. Qe2 { The two most effective squares that White’s queen can occupy in this opening are e2 and c2. At c2, the queen supplements the rook’s action in exploiting the c-file, while in another direction guards the strategically important e4-square from invasion by Black’s f6-knight. At e2, the queen prevents Black from breaking up the kingside pawn position by 10...Bxf3, supports an advance of the e-pawn which would monopolize the centre, and clears the way for the f1-rook to reach d1. Developing the queen to e2 offers another advantage: attack on the queenside. By playing 11 Ba6, White can force an exchange of bishops and then bring pressure to bear on Black’s light squares, weakened by the removal of the bishop controlling those squares. } 10... Nd5 { Black’s purpose in this is to free his cramped position by bringing about an exchange or two. } 11. Bxe7 { White is willing to simplify by clearing away some pieces, as he can then return to his theme of exerting painful pressure on the c-file. The alternative, retreat by 11 Bf4, offers Black a choice of too many good continuations. He could play 11...Nxf4 (leaving himself with the two bishops) 12 exf4 Nf6 followed by 13...Nd5, keeping a piece permanently on a square where no enemy pawns could dislodge it, or Black might attack the centre at once with 11...c5. Finally, he could swing the d7-knight over to f6 with a respectable game. White’s actual move has the merit of restricting Black’s choice of reply. } 11... Qxe7 { This is preferable to capturing by 11...Nxe7 as Black gets his queen into play and unites his rooks. Naturally, he cannot go in for 11...Nxc3 12 Bxd8 Nxe2+ 13 Bxe2 Rfxd8 14 Rxc7 (triumph of the rook on the open file) as it loses a pawn and the game. } 12. Nxd5 { This time the knight exchange suits White, who now can dictate the course of events. } 12... exd5 { Forced, as 12...Bxd5 13 Bxd5 exd5 14 Rxc7 costs a pawn. In forcing Black to take with the pawn, White has compelled the closing of the long diagonal, so that Black’s bishop is now terribly limited in scope. } 13. Bb5! { Presto! The file is suddenly open, and the c-file action begins with the rook’s attack on the c7-pawn. } 13... Qd6 { Black guards the pawn and prepares to dislodge White’s bishop by 14...c6. It is already too late to advance the pawn to c5 as after 13...c5 (seemingly a safe move as the pawn is triply defended and only twice attacked) 14 Bxd7 Qxd7 (note how White disposes of two of the defenders with one stroke) 15 dxc5 bxc5 16 Rxc5 White wins a pawn. } 14. Rc2 { White makes room for the other rook at cl, to add to the pressure. The device of doubling rooks on an open file more than doubles their strength on that file. } 14... c6 { Black tries to evict the annoying bishop. } 15. Bd3 { This is much stronger than 15 Ba4, when Black gets some troublesome counterplay by 15...b5 16 Bb3 a5 (threatening to win the bishop by 17...a4) 17 a3 Nb6, and the knight settles itself firmly at c4. } 15... Nf6 { Blissfully unconscious of the impending danger, Black goes about his business, which in this case consists of bringing the knight over to attack, and perhaps to occupy e4. Ordinarily, this is commendable procedure, but all strategy must be conditioned by the circumstances, the position at hand. All moves must be made with respect to the threats of the opponent, not to arbitrary judgements which declare that certain moves are always ‘good’ or ‘bad’. All moves must be measured by their worth in the particular position being played. White has declared his intention of piling up as much pressure as possible on the c-file and on the c6-pawn. Black must meet that threat by bringing all his resources to bear for defence of the file, or institute a counterattack vigorous enough to divert White’s forces from the assault. Black must do something to resolve his immediate difficulties, and he must do it at once, before his opponent gets a death grip on the open file. With his last move, Black misses a golden opportunity – his last chance to play 15...c5, establish a state of tension in the centre, and give his pieces more room to move around in. } 16. Rfc1 { This fixes Black’s c-pawn by preventing it from moving; if 16...c5, then 17 dxc5 bxc5 18 Rxc5 and White wins a pawn. } 16... Rac8 { Rushing to the defence of the c-pawn and renewing (now that Black realizes his peril) the possibility of pushing the pawn. } 17. Ba6! { Very fine strategy! White wants to remove Black’s bishop, since minor pieces are excellent defenders of pawns that are attacked by the heavy pieces. White’s rooks could never seriously threaten the c-pawn while the bishop protected it. } 17... Bxa6 { Was there anything else Black could have done? If 17...Rc7, White wins by 18 Bxb7 Rxb7 19 Rxc6 or if 17...Qc7, then 18 b4 further restrains the pawn, after which White intensifies the pressure by 19 Ne5, simplifies by exchanging bishops and then takes the pawn off. } 18. Qxa6 { The queen comes closer, attacking not only the a-pawn directly, but also the c-pawn indirectly by the threat 19 Qb7 Rc7 20 Rxc6 Rxb7 21 Rxd6, and White wins. } 18... Rc7 { Looks good, as Black saves the a-pawn, keeps the queen out of b7, and prepares to double rooks and to supply the wretched pawn with another defender. } 19. Ne5 { White’s strategy is simple: he piles up more pressure on the c-pawn. It is now attacked by three pieces and defended by two. } 19... c5 { The planned 19...Rfc8 lets White win nicely by 20 Nxc6 Rxc6 21 Qxc8+! Rxc8 22 Rxc8+ Qf8 23 Rxf8+ Kxf8 24 Rc7 a5 25 Rb7 and the rest is child’s play. } 20. Rxc5 { From now on, White simply removes anything that isn’t nailed down. } 20... Rxc5 { Black is not wild about exchanging pieces when he is a pawn down, but what can he do? If he disputes the c-file by 20...Rfc8 then 21 Qxc8+ wins, as in the earlier note, while on 20...Re7 (the c7-rook’s only flight square) 21 Rc6 Qd8 (or 21...Qb4 22 Nd3 Qd2 23 R6c2 Qa5 24 Qxa5 bxa5, and the forced exchange of queens leaves Black’s position in ruins) 22 a3 White’s threat of winning the queen by 23 Rc8 Qd6 24 R1c6 is hard to meet. } 21. Rxc5 { The rook recaptures, disdainful of the pinned pawn which is helpless to remove it, and remains in control of the valuable open file. } 21... Nd7 { This looks attractive as the knight attacks two pieces. If White replies 22 Nxd7, then 22...Qxd7 leaves a queen and rook ending which is not easy to win. White would eventually have to advance his pawn majority on the kingside and expose his king to a possible drawing perpetual check. If the rook retreats, Black continues 22...Nxe5 23 dxe5 Qxe5, again with drawing chances. } 22. Rc6 { Neatly side-stepping the knight exchange, the rook gains time by attacking the queen. } 22... Nb8 { Black is forced into making this ‘combination’ as the retreat by 22...Qe7 is disastrous after 23 Rc7 (pinning the knight) 23...Rd8 24 Qb5 (triple attack!), and White wins a piece. } 23. Rxd6 { Simplify! That’s the magic word to remember in endings where you have an advantage in material. With you are a pawn ahead, reduce the material (and your opponent's chances) by exchanging pieces, if it does not weaken your position. } 23... Nxa6 { Forced, of course. } 24. Nc6! { A master move! You or I might grab the d-pawn in order to be two pawns ahead. This could win, but why complicate matters? Why let Black seize the c-file with 24...Rc8 and start a counterattack? Note that Pillsbury retains his attack on the d-pawn with the text-move, adds to it a threat against the a-pawn and prevents Black from playing 24...Rc8, when the knight check at e7 would annihilate him! It is subtle moves in apparently simple positions and not queen sacrifices that mark the master player. } 24... g6 { Sooner or later, the king will need some air. The king is also anxious to lend a hand in the ending by moving toward the centre, by way of g7. } 25. Nxa7 { Another pawn falls, while two more are threatened by the rook. } 25... Ra8 { Unable to get to c8, the rook makes frantic efforts to enter the fight. } 26. Nc6 { The knight withdraws, still in position to punish 26...Rc8 by 27 Ne7+ winning the rook. } 26... Kg7 { Black moves the king out of range of the knight check and closer to the centre. } 27. a3 { There is no hurry about taking the d-pawn. White guards his a-pawn from any discovered attack on it by the rook hidden away at a8, and also prevents Black’s knight from later emerging at b4. Note that White avoids 27 Rxd5 Rc8 28 Rd6 (the knight cannot move due to the mate threat) 28...Nb4, when Black wins the helpless knight. } 27... Rc8 { Finally posting his rook on the coveted file, but can Black make use of it? } 28. g4 { White’s king also needs an escape square. Black was threatening to win a piece by 28...Nb8, twice attacking the knight which could not run away. The break-up of the pawn position around the castled king is of no consequence in the ending. It is in the opening and middlegame that these moves endanger the health of the king, as then he may be assaulted by every piece on the board. } 28... Nc7 { Black protects his d-pawn, but at the cost of blocking the rook. There was little choice because White was threatening 29 Ne7 (attacking the black rook and a couple of pawns) 29...Rc1+ 30 Kg2 Rb1 31 Rxb6, and the two connected passed pawns assure White an easy win. } 29. Ne7 { Once again chasing the rook from the open c-file. White threatens the rook, attacks the b-pawn and doubly attacks the d-pawn. } 29... Rb8 { Black must hang on to the b-pawn as long as possible, as with its loss White’s pawns on the queenside are free to go on to queen. } 30. Rd7! { The pressure must not be relaxed! Pillsbury prefers this to the rook ending resulting from 30 Nxd5 Nxd5 31 Rxd5, though that would also win. } 30... Ne6 { The knight must leave, as the effort to protect it by 30...Rb7 fails after 31 Nxd5 winning a piece. } 31. Nxd5 { The d-pawn falls at last, giving White a passed pawn on the d-file and a rook on the seventh rank (in addition to the pawns he picked up). } 31... Rc8 { Rather than be gradually crushed to death, Black gives up another pawn to get some sort of counterplay on the open file. If his rook can get behind White’s pawns, it might gather up a couple of them. } 32. Nxb6 { White can play safe and keep the rook out by 32 Nc3 but capturing the b-pawn leaves him with three passed pawns – an offer hard to resist! } 32... Rc2 { Occupation of the seventh rank is the logical consequence of play on an open file by a rook. This could mean trouble for White except that he has powerful antidotes in all those pawns ready to rush up the board to become queens! } 33. b4 { The pawn lightly evades the rook’s attack. } 33... Ng5 { White’s pawns are not readily hindered from advancing, but perhaps White’s deserted king might be sensitive to an attack by knight and rook. } 34. a4! { White goes calmly about his business of pushing the passed pawns and getting a queen. It was tempting to drive the knight off with 34 f4 but this move, believe it or not, enables Black to draw the game! After 34 f4 Nf3+ 35 Kf1 (definitely not 35 Kh1 Rxh2#) 35...Rd2! 36 Nc4 Nxh2+ 37 Kg1 Nf3+ 38 Kf1 Nh2+ 39 Ke1 Nf3+ Black draws by perpetual check. } 34... Ne4 { Black tries another means of entry. } 35. a5 { Again, Pillsbury resists the impulse to get in a dig at the knight. If 35 f3, then 35...Ng5 again threatens 36...Nxf3+ and a draw by perpetual check. } 35... Nxf2 { Can Black conjure up a mating attack? } 36. a6 { White demonstrates the futility of his opponent’s gestures by paying no attention to them! The passed pawn has only two more squares to cover and cannot be stopped in its march. Black decides that it would be too much to hope for this bit of luck: 36...Nh3+ 37 Kh1? Ng5 38 a7? Nf3 39 a8QRxh2#! Of course, White would play 37 Kf1, when he wins easily. } 1-0

1. d4 { In the opening, it is advantageous to occupy the centre with a pawn and to develop the pieces with a view to controlling the centre. White begins by placing a pawn where it takes complete possession of one important square and attacks two others. Control of the two squares e5 and c5 makes it impossible for Black to place pieces there. White can hope to use e5 and c5 as outposts for his pieces, which will have the support of the d-pawn. The advance of the d-pawn serves an additional purpose in opening lines for White’s queen and c1-bishop. } 1... d5 { This is the simplest way for Black to get an equal grip on the centre and to prevent White acquiring more territory with 2 e4. } 2. c4 { White offers a pawn to divert Black’s d-pawn from the centre. In effect, it is an offer to exchange a flank pawn for a centre pawn, as White can regain the pawn without any trouble. Concealed in White’s proposal is a threat of destroying Black’s pawn-centre by 3 cxd5 Qxd5 4 Nc3 (gaining a tempo, as White develops a piece while Black must move the same one again) 4...Qa5 5 e4, and White’s control of the centre is imposing. } 2... e6 { Black defends the centre by supporting the d-pawn with another pawn. If White plays 3 cxd5, Black can recapture with a pawn and maintain a pawn in the centre. Black does not capture White’s c4-pawn as that means surrendering the centre and his grip on e4. The shutting in of his c8-bishop (after 2...e6) and the consequent difficulty in developing that piece effectively is one of the reasons for the popularity of the Queen’s Gambit – for White. } 3. Nc3 { A good move, as the knight attacks the two central squares e4 and d5, adding its influence to the pawn’s pressure on the latter. } 3... Nf6 { Black’s knight develops toward the centre, where its mobility is greatest and where it can counter the pressure exerted by White’s knight. } 4. Bg5 { A pin which threatens 5 cxd5 exd5 6 Bxf6, when Black must either submit to being left with a badly doubled pawn by 6...gxf6 or lose a pawn after 6...Qxf6 7 Nxd5. The threat is actually of minor importance. White’s real aim in pinning the knight is not to institute a threat that can so easily be parried. What White is interested in is the most effective placement of his pieces, and the development of the bishop at g5 is extremely strong. The restraint it places on Black’s knight and the cramping effect it has on Black’s whole game is not easily shaken off. } 4... Nbd7 { In queen’s pawn openings, Black’s queen’s knight does its best job at d7, not c6. At d7 it supports the other knight and helps prepare the advance of the c-pawn to c5. The b8-knight must not move to c6, where it obstructs the c-pawn. The c-pawn must be free to advance and attack White’s centre. Black incidentally sets a trap with the text-move, which is designed to catch the greedy player. } 5. e3 { Why not win a pawn by 5 cxd5 exd5 6 Nxd5 instead? There would then follow 6...Nxd5! (the knight breaks the pin by brute force) 7 Bxd8 Bb4+ 8 Qd2 Bxd2+ 9 Kxd2 Kxd8 and Black has gained a piece. White could not fall into the trap if he followed the principle which covers these cases: Do not chase after pawns at the expense of your development. White’s last move supports the central d4-pawn and creates an outlet for the f1-bishop. } 5... c6 { Black strengthens his d-pawn and opens a diagonal for his queen’s use. He plans a counterattack beginning with 6..Qa5 and 7...Bb4 . } 6. a3 { This puts a stop to any such manoeuvre, as Black’s bishop can never get to b4 to pin the knight. } 6... Be7 { Black develops a piece, unpins the knight and clears the back rank for castling. } 7. Qc2 { An ideal development for the queen in this opening. At c2, the queen exerts pressure on the c-file (which will be strongly evident after centre pawns are exchanged) and controls the e4-square. The latter circumstance is the reason for the queen coming into play at this point, instead of the expected mobilization of the kingside pieces. It is vital to guard the e4-square so that Black cannot free himself easily by playing 7...Ne4 and exchanging some pieces. } 7... O-O { Black moves his king to safer quarters. He cannot free his crowded position by the Lasker manoeuvre 7...Ne4 as White responds 8 Bxe7 Qxe7 9 Nxe4 dxe4 10 Qxe4 and wins a pawn. Notice that White’s pawn at a3 prevents Black from regaining the pawn by 10...Qb4+, showing that White’s sixth move was not a waste of time. Instead of the passive kingside castling, Black should have tried for counterplay by 7...dxc4 8 Bxc4 e5!, which disputes control of the centre and helps clear a diagonal for his c8-bishop. } 8. Nf3 { White brings his king’s knight to its best post and attacks the e5-square again, putting an end to any contemplated break by ...e5. } 8... a6 { Preparation for the manoeuvre 9...dxc4 10 Bxc4 b5 11 Bd3 Bb7, followed by an eventual ...c5. This would serve to develop the c8-bishop, free his queenside and start action against White’s pawn-centre. } 9. Rd1! { If Black is going in for an attack on the wing, White is prepared to meet it with the recommended antidote – play in the centre! The position of the rook at d1 acts as a deterrent to central pawn exchanges by Black, as any clearances on the d-file increase the pressure of the rook on that file. } 9... Re8 { Black brings his rook to the e-file, as the centre is usually the theatre of action. } 10. Bd3 { With the entrance of this bishop, White’s development is nearly complete. Notice that he plays no combinations of any sort, either to win material or to start an attack on the king, until most of his pieces are brought off the back rank and into play. It is only after these pieces are posted where they are most effective – where they control the centre, enjoy their greatest mobility, and take possession of a good part of the important territory – that White looks around for a combination, a stroke that will decide the game quickly. } 10... dxc4 { Black has delayed taking this pawn until White’s f1-bishop made a move, so that the bishop will now lose a move in recapturing. } 11. Bxc4 { The recapture is forced. } 11... b5 { Black makes the bishop lose time in retreating and vacates the b7-square, ready for the development of the c8-bishop. } 12. Bd3! { From this square, the bishop manages to be remarkably useful: It reaches out in two directions to attack, it helps guard e4 from invasion, it threatens Black’s kingside and, by attacking h7, prevents Black from freeing himself by means of 12...c5. } 12... h6 { If 12...c5, then 13 dxc5 Bxc5 (certainly not 13...Nxc5 14 Bxh7+ and White wins the queen by discovered attack) 14 Bxh7+ and White wins a pawn, as the pinned knight is helpless to take the bishop. With the text-move, Black moves the h-pawn out of the attack of White’s queen and bishop. Now he hopes to free his queenside and establish a state of tension in the centre by 13...c5. Incidentally, he would like White’s g5-bishop to declare its intentions. } 13. Bxf6! { A very fine concept! White does not waste time holding on to the two bishops but plays to prevent any counterplay by ...c5. If he can keep the c-pawn from advancing, Black’s game will be fearfully cramped, and he may never solve the problem of getting his light-squared bishop settled on a decent square. The immediate object of 13 Bxf6 is to divert one of Black’s recapturing pieces, the knight or the bishop, from its surveillance of the c5-square and the support of a pawn moving to that square. } 13... Nxf6 { This is probably better than taking with the bishop, as Black’s queen and c8-bishop now have more freedom. } 14. O-O { The king (who must be secure from danger at all costs) goes into hiding, while the rook (that must take part in the fighting) comes closer to the scene of action. } 14... Bb7 { With rook and queen on the same file, it would be foolhardy to venture on 14...c5. White simply takes the pawn, 15 dxc5, and punishes the recapture 15...Bxc5 with 16 Bh7+ winning the queen. Black’s idea, besides that of developing the light-squared bishop, is to bring his rook to c8 and then push the c-pawn. } 15. Ne4! { White clears the c-file so that he now has three pieces (queen, knight and d4-pawn) concentrating their power on c5, with the aim of making an advance of Black’s c-pawn to that square impossible. Notice too how White has resisted the temptation to play e4, filling up the centre with pawns. Instead he keeps the e4-square free and utilizes it as a springboard for his pieces. } 15... Nxe4 { Otherwise, White might swing the knight over to c5 and completely smother Black’s queenside. } 16. Bxe4 { Still keeping Black under restraint: he may not play 16...c5 as his b7-bishop would be snapped up. } 16... f5 { Black must drive the bishop off at once, even at the cost of weakening the pawn position on his kingside. A delay gives White time to play 17 Ne5 (intensifying the pressure on the c-pawn and incidentally providing the f3-square for a bishop retreat) followed if need be by 18 Rc1. } 17. Bd3 { The third visit of the bishop to this square. White must not be hasty and play 17 Bxc6 as the reply 17...Rc8 pins the bishop. } 17... Qb6 { Once again preparing the liberating pawn-push. } 18. Rc1 { The position demands that White devote all his efforts to sustaining the blockade of Black’s c-pawn. White must acquire undisputed control of the c5-square, so that the pawn may never advance. He must not relax for a moment, as domination of the key c5-square virtually assures him of a positional win. } 18... Rac8 { Black persists in his plan to push the pawn. If he does not get this move in, his b7-bishop will never have any air. } 19. b4! { White nails the pawn down! White has a won game, strategically. What remains is to apply the proper tactical touches to compel the opponent to yield. The time is ripe for the combinations to appear! } 19... Qd8 { Ready to parry 20 Qb3 (threatening 21 Qxe6+ or 21 Bxf5) with 20...Qd5. } 20. Ne5 { A powerful blow! White attacks the unfortunate c-pawn (which must stay where it is) a third time. Against passive resistance, White plans 21 f4 (to give his knight additional support and to stabilize the centre), followed by 22 Be2 and 23 Bf3, after which the c-pawn must perish. } 20... a5 { Black attacks one of the pawns hemming in his queenside. Against 20...Bf6 White sticks to the script with 21 f4, followed by 22 Be2 and 23 Bf3. } 21. Qb3! { Again threatening 22 Qxe6+ or 22 Bxf5. White probably gave no more than a glance to 21 bxa5, to which Black can reply 21...Qxa5, 21...Bxa3 or 21...c5, any of which gives him far too much freedom – from White’s point of view! } 21... Bd6 { The defence that Black had relied on is ruled out: if 21... Qd5, then 22 Qxd5 and White wins a pawn after 22...exd5 23 Bxf5 or 22...cxd5 23 Bxb5. } 22. Bxf5 { The first bit of actual violence brings in a pawn. } 22... Qf6 { With an attack on the bishop and a double attack on the knight, Black hopes to get his pawn back. } 23. Bb1 { The idea of this withdrawal to the back rank is to support the queen in an attack along a diagonal, either by moving the queen to c2 or by shifting the bishop to a2 behind the queen. } 23... Bxe5 { Black does not care to part with the services of an active piece, but he must do so in order to recover the pawn he lost. } 24. dxe5 { Forced. } 24... Qxe5 { Material is even, and Black seems to have survived the worst. It is true that White can win a pawn by 25 bxa5, but he would be left with doubled and isolated pawns on the a-file, and it is doubtful that he could get any advantage from the extra pawn. There must be a better reward for fine positional play than this dubious bounty! } 25. Rc5! { White spurns the pawn, in favour of piling on more pressure. The rook now holds Black’s queenside in a paralysing grip. The strength of White’s move is evident in the fact that the rook can never be dislodged! } 25... a4 { An intermediary move, whose purpose is not only to save the pawn, but also to gauge White’s plans by his next queen move. } 26. Qa2! { A remarkable retreat! One would expect 26 Qc2 so that the queen, backed up by the bishop, might penetrate Black’s kingside position. However, Black refutes this cleverly by 26...Qf6 and now: 1) 27 Qh7+ is met by 27...Kf7, when White has no means of furthering the attack. 2) 27 e4 (intending to banish the queen by 28 e5 and then pierce the position) 27...e5 and Black repels any invasion. } 26... Qd6 { The defence 26...Qf6 succumbs to 27 e4! (now we see the point of 26 Qa2 – it is to pin Black’s e-pawn and prevent 27...e5 at this point) 27...Rcd 8 28 e5 Qf4 29 Qc2 (threatening 30 Qh7+ Kf8 31 Bg6 Re7 32 Qh8#) 29...Qg5 30 f4 Qg4 31 Rc3, when the entrance of the rook at g3, followed by 33 Qh7+, is conclusive. Notice that the move 31 Rc3, relaxing the pressure on the queenside, is not an infraction of principle. An attack that leads to a forced win takes precedence over positional considerations. } 27. Qc2 { Now this grouping has more effect! White threatens 28 Qh7+ Kf8 29 Bg6 Red8 30 Qh8+ Ke7 31 Qxg7#. } 27... Rcd8 { If 27...e5 to guard the g6-square with the queen, then 28 Qh7+ Kf7 (on 28...Kf8, 29 Bg6 wins easily) 29 f4 (threatening 30 fxe5+) 29...e4 30 Ba2+ Kf6 31 Qf5+ Ke7 32 Qf7+ and White wins the bishop, as a start. } 28. Qh7+ { Control of the light squares leading to Black’s king renders this a decisive invasion; the cramping of Black’s queenside and the smothering of his bishop make it difficult for Black to hold out. } 28... Kf8 { On 28...Kf7 White can either win the exchange by a bishop check or pursue the attack by 29 f4, when the continuation might be 29...Rh8 30 Qg6+ Kf8 31 f5 e5 (or 31...Qe7 32 f6) 32 f6 and White wins. } 29. Bg6 { Further confines the king while attacking the rook. The threat is 30 Qh8+ Ke7 31 Qxg7#. Black can only delay the execution at great cost in material. White’s play is a fine example of the value of preventive strategy. In paralysing Black’s queenside, he demonstrates the extraordinary fact that weaknesses on one wing can lead to complete collapse on the other! Once Black is held in restraint, his efforts to make some sort of stand seem little more than feeble flutterings. } 1-0

1. d4 { Beginning the game with this pawn move releases two pieces at one stroke. This is as much as White can achieve in one move in the way of getting the pieces off the back rank and into play. The pawn itself plays an important part in the struggle for domination of the centre and the control of key squares. } 1... d5 { Probably Black’s best reply. With it, he offsets White’s pressure on the centre. } 2. c4 { This is an attack, as well as an offer of a pawn. It is an attack in that White threatens by 3 cxd5 Qxd5 4 Nc3 Qa5 5 e4 to establish two pawns abreast in the centre. It is an offer, since Black can gain a pawn (temporarily, it is true) by 2...dxc4. Either way you look at it, White’s purpose is to destroy Black’s pawn-centre, either by removing Black’s d-pawn from d5, or enticing it away from there. } 2... c6 { Black is ready to meet 3 cxd5 with 3...cxd5, recapturing with a pawn in order to maintain a pawn in the centre. Black’s second move has the merit of not shutting in the c8-bishop, as the alternative 2...e6 does. On the debit side though, if Black does develop his bishop freely, he must be prepared to beat off troublesome attacks on his d-pawn and his b-pawn, occasioned by the absence of the bishop. Another and more important consideration is that while the c-pawn standing at c6 represents a fine support for the d-pawn, it is not fulfilling its main purpose in life, which is to challenge White’s control of the centre. It must be available to advance to c5 in order to attack White’s d-pawn and to open the c-file for the use of Black’s heavy pieces. } 3. Nf3 { Why doesn’t White play 3 c5 and stifle his opponent completely on the queenside? These are some of the reasons he does not do so: 1) It is good strategy to maintain tension in the centre – to keep the pawn position fluid, not static. 2) In advancing to c5, White gives up his attack on the enemy centre, and the option of exchanging pawns when it is worthwhile to do so. Such an exchange might be the means of demolishing Black’s whole centre! 3) The c5-square should be an outpost for a piece, not a pawn. A piece posted there exerts a tremendous effect on Black’s whole queenside. 4) Placing a pawn at c5 closes the c-file and makes it useless for the operations of the queen or the rooks. 5) In the opening, pieces, not pawns, should be moved. All the foregoing explains why a chess master ‘instinctively’ finds the right moves. It is not that he can analyse twenty moves ahead, or that he bothers to examine the effects of every possible move. Sometimes he does not even look one move ahead! He saves time by dismissing from consideration any move which his instinct (or more accurately his experience and judgement) warns is contrary to principle and cannot possibly lead to favourable results. By discarding moves which offend his feeling for what is proper, by avoiding artificial expedients which are distasteful to his positional judgement, he plays stronger, sounder chess at ten seconds a move than does the average amateur in his serious tournament games. } 3... e6 { This quiet move strengthens his centre and frees the f8-bishop. Black’s intentions are still unclear. He might capture the c4-pawn next move and then try to hold on to it by ...b5, or he might go in for the Stonewall formation, by playing 4...f5 followed by 5...Nf6 and possibly 6...Ne4. } 4. e3 { White plays safe by protecting the c4-pawn. He releases one bishop at the expense of another, but one cannot have everything. } 4... Nf6 { The knight takes up a good post, extending powerful influence on d5 and e4, two of the four strategically important squares in the centre. } 5. Bd3 { The bishop occupies a diagonal where it can operate with great effect, while the kingside is cleared for speedy castling. Broadly speaking, it is good policy to develop the kingside pieces first, so that the king can find safer quarters. Most players are familiar enough with this procedure and its benefits to carry it out faithfully, some even to the extent of completely forgetting about releasing the queenside pieces! } 5... Nbd7 { Excellent, as the knight supports an eventual thrust at White’s centre by ...c5 or ...e5. Being in touch with the other knight also has its uses, as it can replace the f6-knight. } 6. Nbd2 { The chief object of this move is to back up an advance of the e-pawn as in the Colle System. A second purpose of the knight’s development at d2 instead of c3 is to recapture with the knight if Black plays 6...dxc4, and then anchor one of the knights at e5, strongly supported by the other. } 6... Be7 { A good defensive move – perhaps too much so! The bishop is well placed at e7, and progress is made toward castling, but no attempt is made to prevent White from expanding and acquiring more territory. Black must get in the counter-thrust ...c5 or be slowly crowded back and confined to a small area. } 7. O-O { The king flees to a safer part of the board, while the h1-rook takes a more active position. } 7... Qc7 { Another quiet developing move, which might better have been replaced by the aggressive 7...c5. Black cannot temporize but must fight for equal rights. Chess is no game for cowards! } 8. e4! { This resembles the Colle device for breaking up the position in the centre and opening lines of attack for the pieces crouched in the background. } 8... dxe4 { Black cannot allow the pawn to go to e5. There it would drive away his f6-knight and put it completely out of action. } 9. Nxe4 { More energetic than recapturing with the bishop. The knight gets out of the way of the c1-bishop and puts the question to the enemy knight. } 9... Nxe4 { Black must exchange to relieve his constricted position. } 10. Bxe4 { The exchange of pieces suits White too. The more material disappears from the board, the more scope there is for the activities of his pieces, especially the wide-ranging bishops. } 10... Nf6 { The attack on the bishop gains a tempo for Black while giving his queenside pieces a bit more room. } 11. Bc2 { The bishop retreats, but to a fine vantage point. It is poised for a kingside attack but can quickly shift to the queenside if necessary. White’s position is distinctly superior. He enjoys these advantages: } 11... b6 { To develop the bishop at b7, since it is shut in by the e-pawn on the other diagonal. } 12. Qe2 { White develops another piece and intensifies the pressure on e5. Control of this square will make it difficult, if not impossible, for Black to free his position by advancing the e-pawn. } 12... Bb7 { With the development of this bishop, Black seems to be finding a way out of his troubles. He is now set to play ...c5 next move, operate on the long diagonal with his light-squared bishop and establish a proper state of tension in the centre. Will he have time for this, or has he missed the right moment to hit out with ...c5? } 13. Ne5! { A magnificent outpost for the knight! From this central station, the knight radiates power in eight directions, accentuating Black’s difficulties in gaining freedom for his pieces. } 13... Rd8 { This looks plausible, since Black mobilizes the rook while attacking a pawn. It is too late, alas, to play the liberating 13...c5; White’s reply 14 Ba4+ would force Black’s king to move (interposing the knight or bishop instead costs a piece) and forfeit the right to castle. } 14. Rd1 { White defends without loss of time. The rook guards the pawn and develops simultaneously, going to the file it would have chosen in any event. Rooks belong on open files, or on files likely to be opened. } 14... O-O { The advance 14...c5 is still premature, being met by 15 Ba4+ and Black must either move the king and lose the castling privilege, or play 15...Nd7 losing the exchange after 16 Bxd7+ Rxd7 17 Nxd7. Before White makes his next move, let us sum up his advantages: Clearly, White has established a definite positional superiority. His pieces have greater mobility, as simple arithmetic shows, and their power to attack is definitely greater than that of Black’s army. White has earned the right to look for a decisive combination that will exploit to the full his positional advantages. It is interesting to see what form of attack will succeed in breaking through Black’s strongly entrenched position. } 15. Bf4! { The bishop develops with a threat against the queen. White intends to play 16 Ng6 next move, discovering an attack on the queen by the bishop. After the queen moves away, White will capture the f8-rook, winning the exchange. } 15... Bd6 { The alternative 15...Qc8, moving the queen out of the bishop’s range, does not look appetizing. With the text, Black prevents the knight from moving and uncovering an attack. } 16. c5! { This begins a series of vigorous blows which do not let up until Black surrenders. White’s idea is twofold: he will dislodge the bishop and permanently seal up Black’s queenside position. } 16... bxc5 { This is forced, as on 16...Bxe5 White can win by 17 Bxe5 Qc8 18 Bxf6 gxf6 19 Qg4+ Kh8 20 Bxh7 Kxh7 21 Rd3 followed by 22 Rh3#. } 17. dxc5 { Another pawn springs up to stab at the bishop. } 17... Bxe5 { Or 17...Bxc5 18 Ng6 and White wins the exchange. } 18. Bxe5 { This recapture attacks the queen and keeps Black on the run. } 18... Qa5 { If 18...Qc8 White wins by 19 Bxf6 gxf6 20 Qg4+ Kh8 21 Qh4 (threatening mate) 21...f5 22 Qf6+ Kg8 23 h4 (intending to push the pawn to h6 and then to mate at g7) 24...Rd7 (to follow with 24...Qd8 driving White’s queen off) 24 Rxd7 Qxd7 25 Rd1 Qc7 26 h5, when the two threats of 27 h6 and 27 Rd3 (followed by 28 Rg3+) are decisive. } 19. Bxf6! { White does away with the knight, the best defender of a castled position, as a prelude to breaking into the stronghold of the king. } 19... gxf6 { After this, Black’s position on the kingside is torn apart, where it should be barricaded. On the queenside, where his pieces need room for their movements, his position is nailed up – and by an unprotected pawn at that! } 20. Qg4+ { This is more accurate than 20 Qe4. It leaves Black with only one reply. } 20... Kh8 { The king must go to the corner. } 21. Qh4 { Now threatening mate on the move. } 21... f5 { Black’s only defence. } 22. Qe7! { Penetrating into the heart of the enemy’s position. The attack on the black bishop is a device whose purpose is to occupy the opponent, even if only for a moment, with the problem of saving the bishop. This will give White the time he needs to carry out his real threat, an attack on both the black rooks. } 22... Bc8 { If Black plays 22...Rb8 to protect the bishop, White wins this way: 23 Qf6+ Kg8 24 Rd3 f4 25 Rh3 (threatening 26 Bxh7#) 25...Rfd8 26 Rxh7 and mate follows. } 23. b4! { A knockout blow! The queen is forced off the diagonal leading to the rook at d8 – which needs her protection! What can Black do? 1) 23...Qxb4 24 Rxd8 Rxd8 25 Qxd8+ wins. 2) 23...Rfe8 is met by 24 Qf6+ followed by 25 bxa5. 3) 23...Rxd1+ 24 Rxd1 leaves two strong threats on tap: 25 Qxf8# and 25 bxa5, which cannot both be parried at the same time. } 1-0

1. d4 { A hundred and forty years ago, players began their games almost automatically with 1 e4, and if they could offer a gambit, they did so. Today, when everyone wants to win with the minimum of risk, 1 d4 has become equally popular. The queen’s pawn openings lead to positions which are safe and sound. They offer security, and as additional inducement let White have a slight advantage right from the start. With his first move, White occupies and exerts pressure in the centre with a pawn which is protected and simultaneously frees his queen and dark-squared bishop. } 1... d5 { The classical reply, this equalizes the pressure in the centre. It also prevents White from playing 2 e4 and monopolizing most of the best squares. } 2. c4 { With several objects in mind: } 2... e6 { Black supports the d-pawn with another pawn. He is prepared, if White plays 3 cxd5, to recapture with a pawn and maintain a pawn in the centre. } 3. Nc3 { A good development for the knight, now that it does not block the c-pawn and the opening of the c-file. It is a bit sharper than 3 Nf3 since it steps up the pressure on d5, an important square in this opening. } 3... c5 { This move had the unqualified endorsement of Tarrasch. He held that Black had no better means of developing his pieces freely and easily, even if pawn exchanges in the centre leave him with an isolated pawn. One advantage of 3...c5 is that it disputes possession of the centre at once by the attack on the d4-pawn. Another is that it enables Black to post his queen’s knight at c6, instead of at d7 where it interferes for a long time with the career of the c8-bishop. } 4. cxd5! { The best way to keep the initiative! This exchange aims to saddle Black with an isolated d-pawn. } 4... exd5 { The safest recapture. Black can offer a pawn by 4...cxd4 5 Qxd4 Nc6 6 Qd1 exd5 7 Qxd5 Be6 but this gambit is dubious. } 5. Nf3 { White’s knights now have all four of the strategically important central squares (e4, e5, d4 and d5) under surveillance. } 5... Nf6 { It makes little difference whether Black plays this or 5...Nc6 first. } 6. g3! { Probably the best of the many good moves White has at his disposal. He can also play the placid 6 e3 or 6 Bf4, either of which gives him a safe, substantial position, or he can attack at once by the aggressive 6 Bg5, with which Alekhine beat Kussman brilliantly in a 1924 simultaneous exhibition. With the quiet text-move, Rubinstein intends to fianchetto his light-squared bishop and increase the pressure on d5. } 6... Nc6 { Black attains one of the objectives that motivated him to select the Tarrasch Defence. His queen’s knight enjoys some influence in the centre, while the light-squared bishop (usually restrained by a knight at d7) is free and unrestrained. } 7. Bg2 { The bishop commands the long diagonal and will devote special attention to Black’s d-pawn. For the moment, the knight obstructs its path, but a knight can readily leap aside. } 7... cxd4 { Black exchanges to give his pieces more scope (note the increased mobility of his dark-squared bishop) but this is not without its dangers. Open lines favour the player whose development is superior, and in this case it is White. Somewhat better is the quiet move 7...Be7, developing a piece or, if Black feels pugnacious, the sharp 7...Bg4 putting more pressure on the d4-pawn by striking at one of its defenders. } 8. Nxd4 { The recapture leaves Black with an isolated pawn in the centre of the board. Such a pawn must depend on pieces to defend it from attack, as there are no pawns on either side that can come to its support. Another consideration is that an enemy piece can be posted firmly on the square directly in front of the isolated pawn, in this case d4, without any fear of being driven off by a pawn. All this is very discouraging, but in return for these shortcomings, the possessor of the isolated pawn is rewarded with open files and diagonals – room for the activities of his pieces. The pawn itself, in spite of its forlorn appearance, often becomes the spearhead that pierces and breaks up a fortified position. The theorists themselves are not in complete agreement on the merits or demerits of an isolated pawn. Many years ago, Philidor said in his Chess Analysed: or Instructions by Which a Perfect Knowledge of This Noble Game May in a Short Time Be Acquired: “A pawn, when separated from his fellows, will seldom or never make a fortune.” For the defence, we have Tarrasch, who said, “He who fears possession of an isolated d-pawn should give up chess.” There are arguments for both sides: } 8... Qb6 { Urging his opponent to exchange knights or defend by 9 e3, blocking the path of his dark-squared bishop. } 9. Nxc6! { A suggestion White is delighted to fall in with! He relieves Black of the isolated pawn, but in return fixes him with other weaknesses. From now on White will forget about the d5-square and turn his attention to dominating d4 and c5 completely. By anchoring pieces on those squares he can prevent Black from advancing his d-pawn or his c-pawn. The effect of blockading these pawns will be to shut in all of Black’s pieces behind the pawns. } 9... bxc6 { The alternative capture 9...Qxc6 loses the d-pawn at once. } 10. O-O { Before pursuing the attack, White conveys his king to safer quarters. The king’s rook meanwhile becomes available for action on the centre files. } 10... Be7 { Unfortunately, Black may not advance either of the pawns marked for doom: if 10...c5, then 11 Nxd5 wins a pawn, or if 10...d4, then 11 Na4 forces the queen to desert one of the threatened pawns. There were better chances of resistance with 10....Be6, protecting the d-pawn once more so as to get in the freeing ...c5 as quickly as possible. Black cannot rely on passive measures or he will be crushed to death. } 11. Na4! { White is not interested in scaring the queen. The knight does not move to attack but to get a grip on the c5-square so that a white piece may settle itself securely there. } 11... Qb5 { The queen stays in the neighbourhood to help ward off the invaders. } 12. Be3! { You would expect this bishop to go to f4, where its range is long and where it does not obstruct the e-pawn’s movements; or you might consider g5 where it cramps Black’s game. These are good and natural moves, but they do not fit in with the strategic concept governing this position. Once there is a definite, logical plan to follow, we must play moves that conform to that plan, so that the improvement of our own position or the undermining of the opponent’s is conducted systematically and not as a result of accidental circumstances. Development, at this point, must not be carried out for its own sake. It may seem strange that control of one square can cause a position to collapse, but it is true. It is one of the fine points in the Queen’s Gambit that such domination (resulting from Black’s neglect to dispute the centre and also free his queenside by ...c5) enables White to confine his opponent’s pieces to a small area and drive them back step by step, while he (White) either starts escorting a pawn to the queening square or turns to the other side of the board and beleaguers the enemy king. } 12... O-O { Not having read the previous note, Black is content to make ‘good’ developing moves. He should concentrate his energies on advancing the c-pawn one square before it is permanently fixed at c6. Pushing the pawn at once is premature, as after 12...c5 13 Bxd5 Nxd5 14 Qxd5 Qxa4 15 Qxa8 White has won the exchange, but Black could put up more fight with 12...Be6 (protecting the d-pawn and preparing to move the c-pawn) followed by 13...Nd7 and 14...Rc8, all of which is designed to help the c-pawn to advance one square. } 13. Rc1 { White seizes the half-open file, brings more pressure to bear on c5, and prepares to post a piece there. } 13... Bg4 { A double attack on the e2-pawn, which may be embarrassing to meet. How does White answer it? If 14 Re1, the rook’s development is wretched. If 14 Nc3, then Q14...xb2 wins a pawn. If 14 Rc2, Black snaps up the knight. If 14 f3, White loosens the pawn position around his king and hems in his own bishop. In spite of all these arguments in favour of Black’s move, Tarrasch used to dismiss such demonstrations with: “Beginning of an attack... } 14. f3 { ...and end of attack!” The hemming in of the g2-bishop is only temporary, and as for the weakness of the king-side pawns, it is of no consequence if Black cannot exploit it. } 14... Be6 { The bishop finds the right square, but it is too late – much too late! } 15. Bc5! { Now that the strategically important d4- and c5-squares are under his control, White stations a piece where it will immobilize Black’s pawns and restrict the movement of his pieces. } 15... Rfe8 { Black must either protect his bishop or submit to an exchange of pieces. The latter option does not appeal to him, as after 15...Bxc5+, the reply 16 Rxc5 replaces one blockader with another and gains a tempo by the attack on the queen. } 16. Rf2! { A very fine move! After White plays e3, the rook can switch over to c2 to help exploit the c-file. It also vacates f1, so that the bishop can occupy a more useful diagonal. } 16... Nd7 { Black attacks the bishop a third time, with the hope of forcing it to retreat. } 17. Bxe7 { The bishop does not withdraw, as that lets Black get in the thrust 17...c5, breaking the bind on his position. Nor does White support the bishop by 17 b4, the kind of move many players would make instantly. The consequence would be 17...Bxc5, forcing the pawn to recapture, since 18 Rxc5 costs the exchange, and 18 Nxc5 allows 18...Qxb4. However, after 18 bxc5 the pawn stationed at c5 is not only immobile and useless but itself closes the c-file to White’s pieces. This would negate the whole strategy of the position, which is to occupy the weak squares in the opponent’s position with pieces, not pawns. Pieces can be freely moved about, so that lines are kept open for the attack, and one blockader can make room for a different one, if occasion demands it. } 17... Rxe7 { Black must recapture. } 18. Qd4! { Excellent! The centralization of the queen is tremendously effective. Not only does the queen exert its influence on every part of the board, but it also both prohibits Black from getting in the freeing ...c5 move and prepares the posting of the knight at c5. Notice how, from its new position, the queen still guards the knight and keeps an eye on the b-pawn. The knight is free to move, while the e2-pawn, abandoned by the queen, is now under the rook’s care. } 18... Ree8 { This rook retreats to help defend the c-file against White’s attack, since a move by the a8-rook costs a pawn. } 19. Bf1 { A subtle means of activating the bishop. The alternative 19 f4 is not nearly as good, as it gives Black’s pieces much more room in which to manoeuvre, his bishop and knight then having access to the e4-square. } 19... Rec8 { Reviving the possibility of playing 20...c5. Black must have realized by this time that if he does not get this move in, he might just as well sit back and wait for the axe to fall. } 20. e3! { Such a little move, but it accomplishes a great deal! It gains a tempo or two as it uncovers an attack on the queen (forcing Black to lose a move by its retreat), opens up a diagonal for the bishop, and clears a pathway on the second rank, so that the rook can switch from f2 to c2 and increase the pressure along the c-file. } 20... Qb7 { Discretion is the better part of valour, as Beaumont and Fletcher said, anticipating Shakespeare. The desperate thrust 20...c5 is refuted by 21 Rxc5, when Black dare not take the rook as his queen is still under attack. } 21. Nc5! { Blockade! The knight settles down on c5 and barricades Black’s position. } 21... Nxc5 { Black removes the knight, not only to get rid of an active blockader but also on the theory that exchanges help relieve a cramped position. } 22. Rxc5 { Not so agile as its predecessor, the new blockader enjoys the privilege of immunity to harassment by pawns or the enemy bishop, which is confined to squares of opposite colour to the one the rook occupies. } 22... Rc7 { Black cannot counterattack; all he can do is sit tight and await events. But how does White profit by his opponent’s lack of mobility? How does he overcome passive resistance? } 23. Rfc2 { First by doubling rooks on the open file, which more than doubles the strength of the rooks. At present, the rooks seem to be biting on granite, but there are ways and means! Have faith! } 23... Qb6 { Black sticks to noncommittal moves, until his opponent declares himself by a threatening gesture. } 24. b4! { This is the point! While the rooks keep a grip on the enemy, the pawn will spearhead an attack on the position. White’s immediate threat is 25 b5, striking a third time at the immobilized c-pawn. } 24... a6 { Black must not allow the pawn to advance. } 25. Ra5! { Shifting the attack so as to keep Black occupied guarding all the weak points (the new target is a6). Transferring the rook does not relinquish the pressure on the c-pawn, which must remain where it is. } 25... Rb8 { Black protects his queen, which was threatened with capture. Other courses offer bleak prospects: 1) If 25...Qxd4 26 exd4 Bc8 (to save the a-pawn), then 27 Rxd5 wins a pawn for White. 2) If 25...Qb7, then 26 Qc5 followed by 27 a4 and 28 b5 engineers a decisive breakthrough. } 26. a3 { Protecting the valuable b-pawn (which is destined to bring the enemy to his knees) before proceeding with the attack. } 26... Ra7 { Black saves the a-pawn, which was under double attack, but loses a different pawn. However, there was no way for Black to safeguard all the vulnerable points. Had he tried 26...Bc8, White would have won a pawn by 27 Qxb6 Rxb6 28 Rxd5, exploiting the pinned c-pawn. } 27. Rxc6! { This bit of plunder is the first material evidence of the merit of White’s positional strategy. It is no more than justice that the c-pawn, the cause of Black’s troubles, should be the first to fall. } 27... Qxc6 { Better than retreating to b7 or exchanging queens: if 27...Qb7, then 28 Raxa6 wins another pawn and leaves White with two connected passed pawns ready to race up the board. Or if 27...Qxd4 28 exd4, then White will gather up the triply attacked a-pawn. } 28. Qxa7 { The recapture keeps Black on his toes. His rook is attacked and so is the a-pawn. } 28... Ra8 { Rescues the pawn, as 29 Rxa6 Rxa7 30 Rxc6 Rxa3 nets Black a pawn in return. } 29. Qc5 { Again taking possession of the c-file and the key square, this time with the queen. } 29... Qb7 { Black avoids the exchange of queens, since after 29...Qxc5 30 Rxc5 Kf8 31 Ra5 Black can save the a-pawn only by abandoning the d-pawn. } 30. Kf2 { Not only to fortify the kingside but to move the king closer to the centre for the endgame, in the event that the queens are exchanged. } 30... h5 { This demonstration does not intimidate White or divert him from his purpose of effecting a decision on the queenside. } 31. Be2 { White shelters the king from any annoying checks that might ensue once the position is opened up. } 31... g6 { Black’s pieces are tied down to the defence of the two isolated pawns, so he makes a waiting move with a pawn. } 32. Qd6 { White responds vigorously by attacking the a-pawn with a third piece. The queen’s further infiltration into Black’s territory also clears the c5-square so that the rook can use that as a springboard to get to the seventh rank. } 32... Qc8 { Black cannot guard all his pawns (if 32....Bc8, then 33 Qxd5), so he deserts the a-pawn to try to get at White’s king via the open c-file. } 33. Rc5! { Not through the Iron Duke! It is more important to retain control of the c-file and to keep Black’s pieces off it than to pick up stray pawns. } 33... Qb7 { The queen hasn’t a wide choice of squares to flee from the rook’s attack. } 34. h4 { This immobilizes Black’s kingside pawns and also guards against any surprise attack on that wing. } 34... a5 { Black tries to open a file for his queen by main force. What else is there? After 34...Kg7 35 Rc7 Qb8 36 Bxa6 Kg8 (or 36...Rxa6 37 Rxf7+ winning the queen) 37 Bb7! Ra7 38 Rc8+ Bxc8 39 Qxb8 White wins easily. } 35. Rc7 { This reduces the queen’s flight squares to the minimum – just one square! White is now in full control of all the strategically important areas – the c-file, the all-important c5-square, the d-file, the sixth rank and the seventh rank. } 35... Qb8 { The only hiding place! The queen is driven further and further back. } 36. b5 { A new source of trouble! White has a passed pawn moving up the board. } 36... a4 { Black must give his rook more room. } 37. b6 { Threatening to continue with 38 b7 Ra7 39 Rc8+ Bxc8 40 Qxb8, winning everything in sight. } 37... Ra5 { The rook accomplishes nothing here, but there is no real defence. } 38. b7! { Renewing the threat of winning the queen by 39 Rc8+. There is no holding out any longer: 1) 38...Kg7 39 Rxf7+ wins the queen at once by discovered attack. 2) 38...Qe8 39 Qb6 wins the rook in an odd way. 3) 38...Qa7 39 Qd8+ Kg7 40 b8Qleaves White with an extra queen. The whole game is a remarkable example of the systematic exploitation of a positional advantage. The manner in which the c5-square is used as a springboard for White’s pieces – the bishop, knight, rook and then the queen occupying it in turn – contributes a bit of sleight of hand to an artistic achievement of the highest sort. } 1-0

1. d4 { This is one of the best moves on the board – and so is 1 e4! Either move establishes a pawn in the centre, while permitting two pieces to come into play. Which move should you adopt? The choice is a matter of taste. Broadly speaking, 1 e4 leads more often to wide-open attacking games, while 1 d4 tends toward a struggle for positional advantage. Blackburne says, “The first piece of advice I would offer to the young student who wishes to improve his chess is that in the formation of his style he should try to follow his own aptitude and temperament. One player derives pleasure in working a game out accurately like a sum in mathematics; another cares for nothing but ingenious combinations and brilliant attacks. It is by far the best for each to develop his own qualities.” } 1... d5 { An excellent reply, as it prevents White from continuing with 2 e4, when the two pawns abreast dominate the centre. Black, too, frees his queen and a bishop. } 2. Nf3 { Instead of this, White often plays 2 c4, offering a pawn. This is a gambit only by the grace of definition, since White recovers the pawn easily while maintaining a strong position. The knight move has the virtue of developing a piece to its most useful post while retaining the option of transposing into the Queen’s Gambit. } 2... e6 { Perfectly safe, but somewhat modest. I would prefer 2...Nf6, which does not commit Black to defensive play and does not interfere with the c8-bishop’s development. The text-move is the best way to support the d-pawn after White has attacked it by c4, but White has not yet made this threatening gesture! } 3. e3! { This quiet move is the prelude to the Colle Attack, a vicious kingside assault. The general plan of the Colle is to advance the e-pawn to e4, after suitable preparation. This consists of the following manoeuvres: 1) developing the f1-bishop at d3, to reinforce the pressure on the vital e4-square and to attack Black’s h-pawn, a tender point after he castles; 2) posting the queen’s knight at d2 (not at c3, as the c-pawn must not be obstructed), to bear down on e4 and lend support to the e-pawn when it reaches that square; 3) castling on the kingside, to mobilize the h1-rook; 4) developing the queen at e2 and/or the rook at e1, to add further weight to the contemplated pawn push; 5) advancing the pawn to e4. The pawn moves only one square, but it sets all the machinery in motion: the position in the centre will be ripped apart and lines opened for White’s attacking forces. } 3... c5 { This thrust at the pawn-centre is practically compulsory for Black in queen’s pawn openings. } 4. c3 { Supporting White’s centre and making ready for Bd3, since it prepares the retreat square c2 in case Black should attack this bishop by ...c4. } 4... Nf6 { Natural and strong. This is the best possible disposition of the king’s knight. It is developed toward the centre, so as to take part in the events there. It is in the centre that most of the fighting takes place, and whatever happens there affects the rest of the chessboard. Superiority in the centre is essential for a positional advantage, and control of the centre is indispensable to the successful conduct of a kingside attack. All development should therefore be conducted with a view to the effect on the centre. A plausible move, instead of the text, is the advance 4...c4 to prevent White from placing his bishop at d3. It is the kind of move many players find irresistible, but it must be avoided. It is an error in strategy, as it relaxes the pressure on White’s d-pawn and the centre. } 5. Bd3 { An ideal development for the bishop: it controls the b1-h7 diagonal leading to Black’s king (after he castles) and bears down on the key e4-square, where the break will come. } 5... Nc6 { The knight comes into play toward the centre, as prescribed. Black has an eye to freeing his game by an early ...e5. A good alternative is 5...Nbd7 in order to recapture with the knight, instead of with the bishop, if White should play 6 dxc5. } 6. Nbd2 { Offhand this looks unnatural, as the knight seems awkwardly placed and blocks the path of the c1-bishop. In reality the knight performs its two assigned tasks: it gets into the game , even if it is only at the modest d2-square, and it also lends support to the coming action at the critical point e4. The c1-bishop is inconvenienced, but only temporarily. } 6... Be7 { This is preferable to the aggressive development at d6. The bishop is needed closer to home for defence of the king. } 7. O-O { This remarkable coup, by means of which the king is spirited away to safety while the rook magically appears on the scene, is probably the most significant contribution to civilization since the invention of the wheel. } 7... O-O { Black also hurries to safeguard his king and put the king’s rook to work. } 8. Qe2 { A perfect spot for the queen in nearly every form of queen’s pawn opening. The queen supports the contemplated advance of the e-pawn and will add a great deal of weight to the consequent attack. } 8... Re8 { Rooks must seize open files! What if there are none? Then bring your rooks toward the centre! They will then be at the head of files most likely to be opened. That is why the king’s rook is usually developed at e8 or d8, while the queen’s rook goes to d8 or c8. } 9. dxc5! { The thrust 9 e4 would be premature: after 9...dxe4 10 Nxe4 cxd4 White would lose a pawn. The text-move was made with these further considerations in mind: 1) Black’s bishop, which has moved once, will have to waste a move in recapturing the pawn; 2) this bishop, needed for the defence of the kingside, will find itself on the wrong side of the board; 3) at c5, the bishop will stand unprotected and subject to a surprise attack; 4) White’s knight at d2 will gain a tempo later by moving to b3, where it threatens the exposed bishop while simultaneously clearing a way for his own dark-squared bishop; 5) in the ending, if it comes to that, White will have the favourable arrangement of three pawns to two on the queenside. } 9... Bxc5 { Black must recapture or be a pawn down. } 10. e4! { The key move in the Colle Attack! It is the forcible break which releases all the fury of the pent-up pieces. How should Black reply? If he exchanges by 10...dxe4, then after 11 Nxe4 Nxe4 12 Qxe4, he is threatened with the devastating 13 Qxh7+. No longer does he have a knight at f6 (the best defender of a castled position) so he would have to weaken himself by moving one of the pawns in front of the king. If he avoids exchanging pawns and plays 10...d4 instead, then comes 11 Nb3 Bb6 (the bishop must stay in touch with the d-pawn) 12 e5 Nd5, and White should win “accurately like a sum in mathematics”, as Blackburne puts it, by 13 cxd4. The attempt to win through “ingenious combination and brilliant attack” by 13 Bxh7+ Kxh7 14 Ng5+ succeeds after 14...Kg6 15 Qe4+ f5 16 exf6+ Kxf6 17 Qf3+ Ke7 (if 17...Ke5, then 18 Nf7#) 18 Qf7+ Kd6 19 Ne4+ Ke5 20 Qh5+ g5 (20...Kxe4 21 Nd2+ Kd3 22 Qg6+ Ke2 23 Qg4+ Kd3 24 Qe4#) 21 Bxg5, leading to mate in a few moves. However, 14...Kg8 15 Qh5 Nxe5 is a dash of cold water, after which White would be hard-pressed to justify his sacrifice. } 10... e5 { Black avoids both pitfalls and plays to prevent 11 e5, which would dislodge the knight. Meanwhile, the rook has more elbow-room, and the c8-bishop can now take part in the action. } 11. exd5 { Work in progress! White continues the process of opening lines for the attack. The e4-square is now available as a jumping-off spot for his pieces. } 11... Nxd5 { Black did not care to capture with his queen, as after 11...Qxd5 12 Bc4 these lines are possible: 1) 12...Qd6 13 Ng5 (threatening 14 Bxf7+, winning the exchange) 13...Re7 14 Nde4 Nxe4 15 Nxe4, and White wins the bishop. 2) 12...Qd7 13 Ng5 Re7 14 Nde4 Nxe4 15 Qxe4 (threatening the h-pawn) 15...g6 16 Qh4 h5 17 Ne4, and Black must give up his bishop to avert loss of his queen by a knight fork. 3) 12...Qd8 13 Nb3 Bb6, and White will have a happy time weighing the effects of various attacks beginning with 14 Bg5, 14 Rd1 or 14 Ng5. } 12. Nb3 { Gaining a tempo by the attack on the exposed bishop. Note too that White’s c1-bishop now has lots of room. } 12... Qb6 { A move with deceptive aspects. It is true that the queen has made a developing move and that the bishop is now protected, but other factors appear in the reckoning. Black’s kingside lacks pieces for defence, and his knight at d5 is loose (unguarded by another piece or a pawn). Is there a combination? Is there a check or capture – a move that does some damage? Yes, indeed there is! } 13. Bxh7+! { Such opportunities must be seized at once, before the opponent has a chance to catch his breath. } 13... Kxh7 { Refusing to capture is even worse: the bishop can run away with his booty or stay put while the attack continues with 14 Qc4, and the queen pounces on the stranded pieces in the centre. } 14. Qe4+ { The point! By means of a double attack White regains his piece, with an extra pawn as interest on his investment. } 14... Kg8 { There is nothing to be gained by interposing a pawn by 14...f5 or 14...g6, either of which moves further disrupts the kingside pawn position. } 15. Qxd5 { White wins the piece back and gains another tempo by the double attack on the bishop. Black is kept busy defending and is given no time to consolidate his position. Without having made any moves that were obviously bad, Black has a theoretically lost game. } 15... Bf8 { Abject retreat, but the alternative 15...Be7 lets White take the poorly defended e-pawn. } 16. Ng5 { Threatening 17 Qxf7+, and mate in two more moves. Black must be given no respite! } 16... Be6 { At last, the light-squared bishop comes into the game. Black’s move looks effective as mate is warded off, the enemy queen driven back, a piece developed, and another one (the a8-rook) released. } 17. Qe4 { The queen retreats, but no time is lost as mate is threatened at h7. } 17... g6 { Black has little choice, and this is a better defence than 17...f5, after which 18 Qh4 Bd6 (or 18...Bc5 19 Nxe6 Rxe6 20 Qc4 winning a piece) 19 Qh7+ Kf8 20 Qg6 Nd8 (if the e6-bishop moves, then its colleague on d6 falls) 21 Nh7+ Ke7 22 Qxg7+ leads to a catastrophe. } 18. Qh4 { Again threatening mate on the move. Black is kept on the run and has to place his pieces where White’s mating threats compel them to go. } 18... Bg7 { White cannot be kept from checking at h7, but this prevents the queen’s further inroad at h8. Failure to keep the queen out, for instance by 18...Bd6 instead, would lose after 19 Qh7+ Kf8 20 Nxe6+ Rxe6 (if 20...fxe6, then 21 Bh6#) 21 Qh8+, and White wins a rook. With the actual move, Black seems to have built a bomb-proof shelter for his king. } 19. Be3 { So White brings up the reserves! The dark-squared bishop comes into active play with gain of tempo. The attack on the queen is incidental to the bishop’s real purpose, which is to gain control of c5 for itself or the knight. A knight planted there would dominate the centre and the queenside; a bishop would be useful to prevent Black’s king escaping by way of f8. } 19... Qa6 { Black rejects 19...Qc7 as he visualizes the continuation 20 Qh7+ Kf8 21 Bc5+ Ne7 22 Qxg6! fxg6 (or 22...Qxc5 23 Nxe6+ fxe6 24 Qxe8+ Kxe8 25 Nxc5 winning easily) 23 Nxe6+ Kg8 24 Nxc7, when Black’s rooks are impaled on a knight fork. } 20. Nc5! { Once more one of White’s pieces invades the enemy’s half of the board by the timesaving expedient of attacking the queen. } 20... Qc4 { Hoping to get some peace by effecting an exchange of queens. } 21. Qh7+ { With the object of smoking the king out and ripping away his pawn protection. } 21... Kf8 { The only move left. } 22. Ncxe6+ { There is often more than one way to win, once a positional superiority has been established. A pretty finish would be 22 Ngxe6+ fxe6 23 Bh6 Re7 (or 23...Bxh6 24 Nd7#) 24 Qh8+ (if only to show that the queen can get to h8) 24...Kf7 25 Qxg7+ Ke8 26 Qg8#. } 22... fxe6 { If Black sacrifices the exchange by 22...Rxe6 then he may prolong but not alleviate the suffering. } 23. Qxg6 { Threatening 24 Qf7#. } 23... Nd8 { I was hoping for 23...Re7, when I could have forced the win by the ‘excelsior’ idea, a pawn march up the board, as follows: 24 f4 (threatening 25 fxe5+ Kg8 26 Qh7#) 24...e4 25 f5 (again threatening to deliver discovered check) 25...e5 26 f6 and White wins. } 24. Nh7+ { Here I was sorely tempted to go in for the flashy win by 24 f4 e4 25 f5 e5 26 f6 Bh8 27 Nh7#, but common sense prevailed. One must win in the quickest possible way and play the simple, brutal move if thereby it shortens the struggle. If 24...Kg8, then 25 Nf6+ Kh8 (or 25...Kf8 26 Qxe8#) 26 Qh7#, or if 24...Ke7, then 25 Rad1, and mate follows after 26 Bg5+ or 26 Qxg7+. } 1-0

1. d4 { Whether for fun, honour or blood, this is one of the best ways to begin the fight. Outlets are created for the queen and a bishop, while the d-pawn itself takes an active part in the struggle for control of the centre. It occupies d4 and stands guard over e5 and c5, making those squares unavailable for the opponent’s pieces. } 1... d5 { The simplest way to stop White gaining more ground in the centre. If White is permitted to play 2 e4 freely, the two pawns abreast in the centre will give him the balance of power in that important area. } 2. c4 { White offers a pawn in order to eliminate Black’s strong point in the centre. It is necessary to play this move before developing the b1-knight at c3, as the c-file must not be obstructed. } 2... e6 { Black is set to reply to 3 cxd5 with 3...exd5, maintaining a pawn at d5. If he were to recapture with a piece, White could attack it, drive it off and create a strong pawn-centre by playing e4. Accepting White’s pawn offer by 2...dxc4 is not recommended policy. Black could not hold on to the extra pawn, so that in the end it would amount to exchanging a centre pawn for a side pawn. It is true that the text-move limits the c8-bishop’s scope, but it is a necessary evil of what is probably Black’s soundest defence. In this lies the great strength of the Queen’s Gambit (for White) and its popularity with the majority of players who feel happy with an opening which lets them exert pressure from the very first move. } 3. Nc3 { The knight develops aggressively, moving in toward the centre and intensifying the attack on Black’s d-pawn. } 3... Nf6 { An excellent move: it brings the g8-knight to its most suitable square in the opening, exerts pressure on d5 and e4 (to neutralize the influence of White’s knight on those squares), helps defend the central d5-pawn and facilitates early kingside castling. } 4. Bg5! { This powerful move develops a piece, pins one of Black’s and threatens by 5 Bxf6 gxf6 (if 5...Qxf6, then 6 cxd5 exd5 7 Nxd5 and White wins a pawn) to dislocate Black’s pawn position on the kingside. Strangely enough, although Pillsbury used this move to great effect in a magnificent victory over Tarrasch at Hastings in 1895, the comment on it by Gunsberg, who annotated the game for the tournament book, was, “No good results from this early sortie of the bishop. The attack, or perhaps better speaking, would-be attack differs from similar play in the French Defence, inasmuch as White has not the move e5 at his command. Generally speaking, both the first and the second player in this opening require their queen’s bishop on the queenside.” This view, it turned out, easily qualified for ‘the clouded crystal ball department’. Pillsbury utilized the attack stemming from 4 Bg5 for some of his most marvellous triumphs, defeating such masters of the game as Steinitz, Maroczy, Janowsky, Burn, Marco and Tarrasch. Others who evaded this line, such as Lasker, Marshall and Chigorin (to name a few) fell victims to other forms of the Queen’s Gambit. Gunsberg, who criticized this form of attack so severely, chose what Lasker called “a peculiar, but not altogether sound, manner of development”, with the result that Pillsbury defeated him in an ending which is one of the most beautiful in the literature of chess. In short, it was Pillsbury’s great success with the Queen’s Gambit that revealed its terrific strength to the other masters and gave it a popularity that has continued to this day. } 4... Be7 { The simplest: Black develops the bishop where it is best placed for defence – close to home. Incidentally, he neutralizes the pin of the knight. } 5. e3 { Pawns should be moved sparingly in the opening, but moves which help pieces come into play are developing moves. In playing 5 e3, White develops because he creates an outlet for his f1-bishop. } 5... O-O { The king finds safer quarters while the rook prepares to make itself useful. } 6. Nf3 { With the development of this piece, White’s knights now exert pressure on all the four squares in the centre. Moreover, the f3-knight has an eye to utilizing e5 as an outpost. Once firmly stationed there, it will get a death grip on Black’s position. } 6... b6 { It is natural to develop the bishop at b7, especially as it is hemmed in on the other side, and indeed this is one of Black’s soundest plans – however, it would have been more accurate to precede it by 6...h6, so as to remove the h-pawn from the vulnerable h7-square with gain of tempo. An alternative continuation was 6...Nbd7 to support a thrust at White’s centre by ...c5 or ...e5. The knight move would also curb White’s ambition to anchor his f3-knight at e5. } 7. Bd3 { An ideal spot for the bishop: it commands an important diagonal and aims at Black’s h-pawn. This pawn is in no immediate danger, but it does stand in the line of fire. } 7... Bb7 { Black expects to control the long diagonal with his bishop by means of this fianchetto. However, Pillsbury’s next move puts Black in a dilemma. } 8. cxd5! { White removes a pawn and lets Black recapture in any of four ways – none of them satisfactory! } 8... exd5 { Black wants to maintain a pawn in the centre, but this pawn blocks the path of his b7-bishop and prevents it from accomplishing anything useful on the diagonal. Black could have captured with a piece instead, but that amounts to an eventual surrender of the centre. White would evict the piece by e4 and remain in control of all the strategically important central squares. } 9. Ne5! { This is the key move in the famous ‘Pillsbury Attack’. The knight anchors itself on a square from which its striking power is terrific! Its attack extends in all directions, affecting the queenside as well as the kingside. } 9... Nbd7 { This knight does what it can: it develops, it threatens to do battle with White’s knight, and it stands ready to support a break by 10...c5, disputing control of the centre. } 10. f4 { This pawn not only strengthens the position of the knight by providing it with a firm base, but it discourages Black from exchanging pieces. On 10...Nxe5, the recapture by 11 fxe5 opens wide the f-file for an attack by the heavy pieces. The capturing pawn itself will then stab at Black’s f6-knight and drive it away from its strong defensive post. } 10... c5 { This demonstration on the queenside is either too soon or too late. Black wants to attack on the queenside where, after playing 11...c4, he will have a three to two pawn majority. What he underestimates is the speed and vigour with which White can get an attack rolling on the kingside. It will strike faster and with more force than any action of Black’s on the queenside. Black must deprive White’s attack of some of its strength by effecting some exchanges and then counterattacking in the centre. One possibility was 10...Ne8 11 Bxe7 Qxe7 12 O-O Nxe5 13 fxe5 f6. This would comply with two important principles in defence: } 11. O-O { A defensive measure (the king should be sheltered) but primarily to put the rook immediately to work on the partly open f-file. } 11... c4 { With the idea of securing a queenside pawn majority. This is commendable strategy for the ending, but Black has not yet survived the middlegame! The move 11...c4 is a strategic error. It removes the pressure on White’s d-pawn and relieves the tension. As long as Black has the option of capturing the d-pawn and disturbing White’s centre, it is difficult for White to stabilize the centre. And until the centre is stabilized, the success of a kingside attack for White is doubtful. The moral is clear: keep the pawn position in the centre fluid; reserve the option of capturing the central pawn. } 12. Bc2 { The bishop retreats but does not relax its grip on the diagonal leading to Black’s kingside. } 12... a6 { Preparing a sweeping advance of queenside pawns, beginning with 13...b5 and 14...b4. } 13. Qf3 { White brings up the heavy artillery. White’s object with the queen move is to start a direct attack on the king, and he gains time because he forces Black to deal with the threat to win a pawn by 14 Nxc4 dxc4 15 Qxb7. To defend himself against White’s threats, Black will be forced to move some pawn near his king. This change in the pawn formation will loosen the structure and create an irreparable weakness in the king’s defences. } 13... b5 { Marco protects the c-pawn and proceeds with his counterattack on the queenside. Note how Black’s last three moves, filling up light squares with pawns, further reduce what little mobility his light-squared bishop has. } 14. Qh3! { Threatening 15 Nxd7 Qxd7 (certainly not 15...Nxd7 16 Qxh7#), after which White has a choice of three winning continuations: 1) 16 Qxd7 Nxd7 17 Bxe7, and White gains a piece. 2) 16 Bxh7+ Kh8 (if 16...Nxh7, then 17 Qxd7 wins) 17 Bf5+, and White wins the queen. 3) 16 Bf5 Qd8 17 Bxf6 Bxf6 18 Qxh7#. “All this is very interesting,” you might say, “but how does White plan this series of moves? What makes him look at even so much as the first move in the combination?” Very well! Let’s try to follow his line of reasoning: White attacks the critical point, Black’s h7-pawn, with queen and bishop. If this pawn were protected only by the king, White could capture it and announce mate. But the pawn has another protector, a knight. How about removing the knight? That would not do. It would only be replaced by another knight. How about getting rid of the other knight? With that knight disposed of, wouldn’t the whole structure collapse? Once White thinks in this direction and sees the first move in the combination, the rest of it plays itself. In fact, once he finds the key – removing the knight which protects the knight which protects against mate – he can win any way he pleases. } 14... g6 { Black avoids being mated by making a simple pawn move. What then has White accomplished, if his mating combination can so easily be frustrated? It is true that White has not inflicted mate, but the threat of doing so has enabled him to achieve his real objective – a disturbance in the line-up of pawns near Black’s king. This change in the pawn configuration weakens the entire defensive structure. After Black’s actual move, his f6-knight, deprived of its pawn support, is a vulnerable object of attack, notwithstanding the fact that it is protected by three pieces. What other defence did Black have? If 14...h6, then 15 Bxh6 gxh6 16 Qxh6 Ne4 17 Rf3 (threatening 18 Rg3+ Nxg3 19 Qh7#) 17...Ndf6 18 Rh3, is winning for White. Or if 14...Nxe5 (to avoid moving the kingside pawns), then 15 dxe5 Ne4 16 Bxe4 dxe4 17 Rad1 Qe8 18 Bxe7 Qxe7 19 Rd7 and the b7-bishop perishes. } 15. f5! { A pawn is a wonderful weapon of attack! This one threatens to break up Black’s pawn cordon by 16 fxg6. The capture will also uncover an attack on Black’s f6-knight by the rook, an attack which could be augmented by doubling rooks. } 15... b4 { Clearly 15...gxf5 is out of the question. White could recapture with the bishop with a tremendous game. Black hopes, with his threat on the c3-knight, to divert White’s attention from the course of events on the kingside. If he can persuade White to delay the attack for even a moment, he might put up a fight. If, for example, White prudently retreats the knight to e2, then 16...Ne4 complicates White’s task. } 16. fxg6! { Ripping right into Black’s position! The rook’s attacking range is lengthened – he has the whole f-file to work on – while the bishop’s attack leads straight to the enemy king! } 16... hxg6 { Let’s dispose of the alternatives: 1) 16...bxc3 17 Bxf6 Nxf6 18 Rxf6 fxg6 (or 18...Bxf6 19 Qxh7#) 19 Bxg6 hxg6 20 Rxg6#. 2) 16...fxg6 17 Qe6+ Kh8 18 Nxd7 Nxd7 (or 18...Qxd7 19 Bxf6+ followed by 20 Qxd7) 19 Rxf8+ Nxf8 20 Qe5+ Kg8 21 Bxe7, and White wins. } 17. Qh4! { Concentrating his fire on the f6-knight, whose position has been weakened by the loss of his pawn support. } 17... bxc3 { Black might as well take the knight. The alternative 17...Nxe5 loses to 18 dxe5 bxc3 19 exf6 Bd6 20 Qh6. Before White makes his next move, let us look at the object of his attack, the knight at f6. Although it has lost the protection of the g7-pawn, which has had to move to g6, it is still immune from capture, since it has a defender for every piece that attacks it. In fact, if White tries something like 18 Bxf6 Bxf6 19 Rxf6 Qxf6 20 Qxf6 Nxf6, he finds himself a rook down. So direct assault doesn’t do it! The answer must then lie in indirect means. We have lured away one of the knight’s defenders, the pawn. Can we get rid of its other protectors? Indeed we can! } 18. Nxd7! { This removes one of the props supporting the knight. } 18... Qxd7 { And this recapture draws another one away! Notice the technique of besieging a heavily guarded objective by doing away with the pieces that protect it. In this case, two of the knight’s defenders have disappeared – one removed bodily, and the other lured away by the compulsion to recapture. Black had no better defence in 18...Nxd7 as 19 Bxe7 Qa5 20 b4 (faster than 20 Bxf8) 20...cxb3 21 axb3 Qb6 22 Rf3, followed by 23 Rh3, forces a quick mate. } 19. Rxf6! { Stronger than 19 Bxf6 as Black dare not take the rook. } 19... a5 { If 19...Bxf6, then 20 Bxf6 threatening 21 Qh8# is conclusive. Black’s actual move prepares 20...Ra6, to help defend the vulnerable g-pawn and perhaps to beat off White’s rook. } 20. Raf1 { Doubling the rooks institutes two new winning threats: 21 Bxg6 fxg6 22 Rxg6# and 21 R1f3, followed by 22 Rh3 and 23 Qh8#. } 20... Ra6 { Hoping to induce an exchange of rooks which would divert one of White’s pieces from the attack. White could still win, but the play would require care. It might go like this: 21 Rxa6 Bxg5 22 Qxg5 Bxa6 23 Rf6 (23 Bxg6 at once is risky and might even lose) 23...cxb2 24 Bxg6 fxg6 25 Rxg6+ Kf7 26 Rg7+ Ke8 27 Qe5+ Kd8 28 Qb8+ Bc8 29 Rxd7+ Kxd7 30 Qxb2, etc. But Pillsbury is not to be swayed! He carries out the motif of the attack with admirable consistency by annihilating the g-pawn that stepped out of line and weakened the defensive formation. } 21. Bxg6! { Logic and poetic justice dictate that this pawn be destroyed! } 21... fxg6 { White was threatening mate on the move. Pillsbury now showed a forced mate in seven moves by 22 Rxf8+ Bxf8 23 Rxf8+ Kxf8 24 Qh8+ Kf7 25 Qh7+ Kf8 (25...Ke8 26 Qg8# or 25...Ke6 26 Qxg6#) 26 Qxd7 followed by 27 Bh6+ Kg8 28 Qg7#. More than any other, this game made the chess world aware of the terrific potential of the Queen’s Gambit, a positional opening, as an instrument of attack. The assault on the kingside is carried out with speed and power, and unlike attacks stemming from speculative king’s pawn gambits, it is founded on a position sound to the core. } 1-0

1. d4 { The queen’s pawn opening, to paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, “offers the maximum of security with the maximum of opportunity.” With the first move, White occupies the centre with a pawn and frees two of the queenside pieces. His general plan of development runs somewhat as follows: He will establish and maintain at least one pawn in the centre. This pawn will act as a support to a knight outpost at e5 or c5. The bishops are to take charge of key diagonals or pin enemy pieces. The rooks are to control the open or partly open files. The queen should stand at c2 or e2, close to home but off the back rank. The king should find safety in castling, preferably on the kingside. Basically, White’s aim is to gain space and crowd Black to the wall. With less room to move around in, and with the consequent difficulty of manoeuvring his pieces effectively, Black will be forced to weaken his position. He will have to make some poor moves, because good moves are not easily available in a cramped position. The weaknesses will come to light, and the opportunity to exploit them will come in the form of a combination, resolving the issue at one stroke. } 1... d5 { This is a more forthright move than 1...Nf6. Either of these moves prevents White from playing 2 e4 and establishing two pawns in the centre. The text-move offsets White’s pressure in the centre and creates a state of equilibrium there. } 2. e3 { A strangely passive move in an opening where every single moment counts. Usually, White strikes at Black’s d-pawn by 2 c4 to weaken his grip on the centre. Or, if White does not want to show his hand too soon, he simply develops a piece by 2 Nf3. } 2... c5 { So Black takes the initiative and plays this all-important freeing move. It opens the c-file for the use of the rooks and gives the b8-knight more scope by letting it come out at c6. The c-pawn itself puts up a fight for possession of the centre by its attack on White’s d-pawn. } 3. c3 { Indicating that he intends to reply to 3...cxd4 with 4 cxd4. This would keep his pawn position in the centre intact and open the c-file for his major pieces. } 3... e6 { Black must protect the c-pawn. Otherwise White might play 4 dxc5, and then hang on to the extra pawn by supporting it with 5 b4. } 4. Bd3 { The bishop develops to a useful diagonal, where it exerts pressure on the centre and is ready to participate in a kingside attack. } 4... Nc6 { A rare opportunity for this knight, who seldom gets good breaks in queen’s pawn openings. From its post at c6 the knight brings considerable influence to bear on e5 and d4 and, as it later turns out, on another important sector. } 5. f4 { White has made four out of five moves with pawns in order to secure a particular arrangement known as the Stonewall Attack. Aside from the fact that making so many pawn moves in the opening is a flagrant violation of principle, the adoption of a system which calls for the launching of an attack by a preconceived formation of pieces, without regard to the advisability of an attack and without reference to the requirements of the particular position, is contrary to the concept of proper strategy and to the spirit of chess itself. What such an expedition amounts to is undertaking the risk of assuming the offensive against an enemy whose force is equal, whose line-up of power is unknown and who has betrayed no vulnerable points. Under these conditions, an attack is premature and is sure to be repulsed and turned into a disorderly retreat. If any such system worked, it would be fine for White, who would always win, but then who would want to play Black? } 5... Nf6 { An excellent development while awaiting developments! Both Black’s knights are poised beautifully, with one watching over e5 and d4, while the other keeps the two remaining central squares under observation. } 6. Nd2 { This knight has the unhappy choice of making its entrance at this square or at a3. At d2, it blocks the bishop and itself has no bright prospects in view. At a3 it is only half a knight, since it reaches at most in four directions instead of eight. } 6... Qc7 { Very good, since the heavy pieces (the queen and the rooks) fulfil their functions best when placed on open files, or files likely to be opened. The queen develops with gain of tempo since a positional threat is involved – which White either overlooks, or disregards. } 7. Ngf3 { Routine and in this case thoughtless development. White is so intent on carrying out the basic theme of the Stonewall attack (posting of a knight at e5, stoutly supported by pawns) that he fails to stop at every move to ask himself, “What does my opponent threaten with his last move? Has he any checks or captures that cut down my choice of reply?” } 7... cxd4! { Black wrenches the c-file open at one blow! } 8. cxd4 { The point of Black’s move is revealed in this forced recapture. White could not take by 8 exd4 (hoping to maintain strong pawn support for the prospective stationing of a knight at e5) as that permits the brutal reply 8...Qxf4 winning a pawn for Black. The alternative, 8 Nxd4, conflicts with the system White had determined to follow before lines of battle were drawn up. In that scheme of things, the knight belongs at e5, not d4, while the d4-square should be occupied by a pawn. } 8... Nb4! { A disturbing attack on the bishop! Without the services of this piece. White can never hope to work up an effective kingside attack. } 9. Bb1 { An unusual square of retreat, but the only one available if the bishop wants to stay on the diagonal leading to Black’s kingside. White is not too troubled by this setback. He expects to drive the enemy knight off with 10 a3 and then reorganize his troops. } 9... Bd7 { A quiet move, but a subtle one. The bishop will make its presence felt, even from this modest start. Black is now prepared to shift his rook over to c8 to strengthen his grip on the c-file. } 10. a3 { Before going about his business, White must dislodge the annoying knight, which disconcerts his entire queenside. } 10... Rc8 { This counterattack must have come as a surprise to White. What shall he do against the threat of 11...Qxc1? If he plays 11 axb4, there comes 11...Qxc1 12 Rxa7 (certainly not 12 Qxc1 Rxc1+, and Black wins a rook) 12...Qxb2 (threatening 13...Rc1, pinning the queen) 13 O-O Qxb4, and Black is a pawn ahead – and a passed pawn at that. } 11. O-O { Now the bishop is guarded by queen and rook, and so safe from capture. The king meanwhile goes into hiding. } 11... Bb5! { The bishop seizesa fine diagonal with gain of time, as White must move his rook out of range. } 12. Re1 { Clearly forced, since 12 Rf2 loses on the spot to 12...Qxc1, while 12 axb4 Bxf1 (threatening to continue with 13...Qxc1) costs the exchange. } 12... Nc2! { An attack on both rooks which leaves White no choice of reply. He must remove this terrible knight. } 13. Bxc2 { After the alternative capture 13 Qxc2, Black plays 13...Qxc2 14 Bxc2 Rxc2 and has a rook on the seventh rank, as in the actual game. } 13... Qxc2 { Black penetrates into the vitals of the enemy’s position – the seventh rank. White is almost paralysed: His e1-rook and queen are prevented from moving by Black’s b5-bishop. His bishop cannot move at all. One knight must stay at d2 to prevent 14...Ne4. The a1-rook can move – but to no avail. } 14. Qxc2 { So he exchanges his helpless queen for Black’s active one. } 14... Rxc2 { The upshot of Black’s positional combination is that it has given him full control of the open file and a grip on the seventh rank with his rook. The position of the rook at c2 has a terribly constricting effect on White’s game. It is especially troublesome as the rook is not easily driven off, while White’s pieces are still in each other’s way. } 15. h3 { To prevent 15...Ng4, an invasion by another piece. } 15... Bd6 { The bishop develops to a useful diagonal. } 16. Nb1 { White’s idea is to rearrange his forces so as to get some freedom of movement. He plans the continuation 17 Nc3 Ba6 18 Rd1, followed by 19 Rd2, to get rid of Black’s annoying rook. By this means, his bishop might eventually see some action. } 16... Ne4! { The knight immediately pounces on this excellent outpost! Not only does this throttle any freeing advance of the e3-pawn, but it also sweeps aside White’s plan of reorganization. If White tries 17 Nc3, then 17...Nxc3 18 bxc3 Rxc3 wins a pawn for Black. } 17. Nfd2 { White therefore tries to exchange or otherwise dispose of Black’s powerfully placed knight. After that, he might arrive at some reasonable development. } 17... Bd3 { Black falls in with this offer, with the stipulation that if knights are to be exchanged, he wants another piece occupying the outpost e4. } 18. Nxe4 { White has no option but to clear the board of as many pieces as he can, otherwise he will never be able to extricate his forces from their tangled position. The move 18 Nc3, which earlier would have lost a pawn, is even worse now because after 18...Nxd2 19 Bxd2 Rxd2 Black wins a piece. } 18... Bxe4 { Black recaptures with the threat of 19...Rxg2+, so White has no time to play 19 Nc3. } 19. Nd2 { White saves the g-pawn by blocking the rook, but he cuts off his own bishop as well – and White’s back to the previous entanglement. Unfortunately, nothing else is promising. If 19 Bd2, then 19...Rxb2 20 Rc1 (getting an open file for the pawn and threatening 21 Rc8+) 20...Kd7, and White will be driven off the file by the threat of 21...Bxb1 winning more material, or 21...Rc8 opposing rooks on the file. } 19... Kd7 { Much more energetic than castling. Mating threats are not likely with so few pieces on the board, hence the king comes out into the open. The king’s power increases with every reduction of force, and, as befits a fighting piece, the king heads for the centre to assist in the attack. Meanwhile, a new avenue has been opened for the benefit of the h8-rook. } 20. Nxe4 { White’s only hope is to keep clearing the board. } 20... dxe4 { After this recapture, a survey shows the inferiority of White’s position: The bishop is undeveloped, preventing communication between the rooks. The pawn cluster in the centre is completely immobilized. All the pieces are still on the first rank. Aside from the features of this particular position, it is important to appreciate the peculiar strength with which a rook is imbued when it dominates (as Black’s does) the seventh rank: The moral is: In the opening, shift the rooks toward the centre, on files likely to be opened. In the middlegame, seize the open files and command them with your rooks. In the ending, post your rooks on the seventh rank. Doubled rooks on the seventh rank are almost irresistible in mating attacks. If there is little material left on the board, the seventh rank is a convenient means of manoeuvring a rook behind enemy pawns. } 21. Rb1 { Preparing to play 22 b4 followed by 23 Bb2, to let the bishop finally see daylight. It is useless to attempt to dislodge Black’s rook, for example after 21 Kf1 Rhc8 22 Re2 Rxc1+ Black wins a piece. } 21... Rhc8 { The doubling of rooks on an open file more than doubles their strength on that file. Their power is manifest here, where they reduce White’s resistance to the feeble hope of developing his bishop. White’s rooks may not leave the first rank unless the bishop does so first. } 22. b4 { This makes the b2-square available to the bishop. } 22... R8c3 { Discouraging that project! Against 23 Bb2, Black plays 23...Rb3, with a double attack on the bishop. This forces 24 Ba1, when 24...Rxa3 wins a pawn for Black, who then doubles rooks on the seventh rank for an easy win. } 23. Kf1 { The king comes closer to guard the rook, which will protect the bishop when it comes off the first rank. Stated in chess language, White intends 24 Bb2 Rb3 25 Re2 (a move previously impossible) when all points are at least temporarily secure. } 23... Kc6 { The king takes a hand in the ending, making its way in along the weakened light squares. Tarrasch’s recipe in similar cases is “The king must be moved (in the ending) as far as is compatible with his safety, right into the enemy camp, where he can capture pawns, hold up hostile pawns and lead his own pawns on to queen.” Reuben Fine says clearly and simply, “The king is a strong piece – use it!” } 24. Bb2 { The bishop manages to emerge, but is it too late? } 24... Rb3 { Immediately attacking the bishop and forcing White’s next move. } 25. Re2 { Clearly the only way to save the bishop without losing the a-pawn. If instead 25 Recl, then 25...Rxb2 wins a piece for Black. } 25... Rxe2 { Black is happy to exchange rooks and simplify the ending. He retains a positional advantage in the superior mobility of his pieces, including his king, who plans to get in among the enemy pawns and wreak havoc there. } 26. Kxe2 { White recaptures and threatens to extricate himself by 27 Rc1+ Kb5 28 Rc2, and the bishop is unpinned while the rook (after 29 Bc1) might even utilize the open file! } 26... Kb5 { Lightly stepping aside, the king evades the check. He is headed for a4, to get a good grip on White’s queenside before starting to undermine the pawns on that wing. } 27. Kd2 { White’s rook and bishop are immobilized, so he is reduced to king moves and not too many at that, as the e-pawn needs protection. } 27... Ka4 { Before starting the decisive combination, Black renders the opposing pawns impotent. } 28. Ke2 { All that White has left, aside from meaningless moves by the kingside pawns. } 28... a5! { Pawns, as we shall see, are unexcelled as spearheads of an attack. They can break through almost any barrier. Black’s threat is 29...axb4 30 axb4 Kxb4, winning a pawn. } 29. Kf2 { On 29 bxa5, 29...Bxa3 regains the pawn and then wins the bishop, while after 29 Kd2 axb4 30 axb4 Bxb4+ 31 Kc2 Ba3 Black exchanges all the pieces to leave himself with an extra pawn and an elementary win. } 29... axb4 { The first bit of booty. } 30. axb4 { Otherwise Black’s pawn continues to wreak havoc. } 30... Kxb4 { Black does not take with the rook or the bishop. Either would give White time for 31 Ra1+ and freedom for his bishop. } 31. Ke2 { White is restricted to waiting moves. } 31... Kb5! { Here, too, moving the king to the a-file or the c-file allows a check by the rook. Black now threatens to double the pressure on the pinned bishop by 32 ...Ba3 and win a piece. } 32. Kd2 { The king moves closer to save the bishop. } 32... Ba3 { Forcing the issue by attacking the bishop again. } 33. Kc2 { The only move. } 33... Rxb2+! { Clearing the board of pieces and reducing to a pawn ending. This is the simplest way of winning an ending with an extra pawn. } 34. Rxb2+ { White must recapture. } 34... Bxb2 { Continuing the simplification. } 35. Kxb2 { The only move. } 35... Kc4 { Threatening to get at the kingside pawns by way of d3. } 36. Kc2 { Preventing the planned invasion. } 36... b5 { Passed pawns must be pushed! This clinches the win, as White cannot stop the pawn without letting Black’s king come in among his deserted pawns. The continuation might be 37 g4 b4 38 h4 b3+ 39 Kd2 b2 40 Kc2 b1Q+ 41 Kxb1 Kd3 42 Kc1 Kxe3 43 Kd1 Kf2, and the new passed pawn moves up the board to become a queen. } 0-1
