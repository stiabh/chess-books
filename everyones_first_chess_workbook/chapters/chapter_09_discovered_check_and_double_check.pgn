{
Discovered check is a tactical theme based on a discovery. A discovered check occurs when the discovery yields a check to the enemy king.
The rook on g8 is aligned with the enemy king on b8. White could move the bishop anywhere and issue a discovered check; however one of the moves is particularly strong:
}
1.Bg6+
{
White’s rook issues the discovered check to the king, while the bishop attacks the rook on c2. Black must get out of the check and then loses the rook on c2. Other discovered checks were possible, but remember that the objective of a tactic is to gain the maximum advantage possible!
}
1...Kb7 2.Bxc2
{
Discovered checks are very powerful. When a discovery creates a check to the king, the piece moving out of the way can move virtually anywhere safely. In order to better solve the problems in this chapter, look for your pieces that are aligned with the enemy king.

{
Double check is when a player uses a discovery to place the opponent in check by two different pieces. Double checks are extremely powerful moves, since when the king is in check by two different pieces, the king MUST move.
Notice that White’s rook is aligned with the black king. White now has the ability to place Black into check, twice!
The best move for White is
}
1.Bg6#
{
Now both the rook and the bishop attack the king. Notice that the knight on f8 can not both block the rook and capture the bishop. On top of that the king has no safe place to move. Double checks are important to spot in your own games. Later in the book, we will use double checks for checkmates and combinations in two moves or more. To better solve the double check problems, look for both discovered attacks and checks.
