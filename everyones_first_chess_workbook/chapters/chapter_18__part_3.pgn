[Event "Intermediate Checkmates and Combinations"]
{***PART III***

**Intermediate Checkmates and Combinations**

By this point, you should be comfortable looking for forcing moves (checks, captures, and threats), unprotected pieces, and the different tactical patterns available in a position. This section of the workbook brings together all of the things you’ve learned earlier in the book and pushes you to the next threshold, 2-3 move sequences.

Since this section deals with tactics and checkmates displayed in more than one move, you must not stop looking for checks, captures, and threats after your first move. To assist your thought process for these puzzles, here are some techniques to use when solving:

- I check, they escape from check, then...
- I take, they take back, then...
- I threaten them, they stop the threat, then...

In other words, you must force yourself to look beyond the first move since, in this section, the concepts are displayed on the second move. This way of thinking is something you will continue to build upon for the rest of your chess improvement journey.

The ability to combine different patterns, tactical themes, and concepts into winning sequences of moves is the final step for a player moving from beginner to intermediate tournament player. This section is certainly the most challenging in the workbook but also the most rewarding. If you grow to feel comfortable with forced sequences that occur in more than one move, then you will become a much stronger player.

This section is broken down into the following chapters:

- Checkmates in two;
- Themed checkmate patterns;
- Combinations;
- Finish like the World Champions.

The format of this section is like the others, except that in the ‘Combinations’ chapter, I give you a guided hint for all problems. Don’t worry; you’ll get a chance to prove yourself in the ‘Finish like the World Champions’ chapter, which is essentially a test to see if you can find forced sequences on your own.}
