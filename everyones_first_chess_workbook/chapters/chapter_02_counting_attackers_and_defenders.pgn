Once you feel comfortable with capturing free pieces, the next step is counting attackers and defenders. Generally, in order to gain an advantage, there must be more attackers than defenders. Another rule of thumb related to counting attackers and defenders is that you should capture with the weakest piece first. In other words, first capture with the piece of the lowest material value since it may be lost in the trade, then you’ll be left with your more valuable piece in the end.

In the position above, White is attacking the rook on d7 with the bishop on c4 and the rook on d3. Black is only protecting the rook once. Now the question is whether White should capture with the rook (5 points) or the bishop (3 points) first. In this case, it makes the most sense for White to capture with the bishop, since it’s 2 points less in value than the rook.

The best move for White is

1...Bxd7 2.Rxd7
{
White has captured a rook (5 points) and bishop (3 points) and only given away a bishop (3 points). White comes out ahead a rook (5 points) and should go on to win the game. There are exceptions when more attackers does not always mean it’s safe to capture.

Let’s take a look at the following example as an exception to the rule.

Here, White’s queen and rook are set up in a battery formation. The battery, in this case, adds up to two attackers: the queen and the rook. The only defender of the knight on d7 is the bishop on c8. Even though White has more attackers than Black has defenders, it is unsafe to capture the knight since White would lose material on the exchange of pieces.

After
}
1.Qxd7 Bxd7 2.Rxd7
{
White has made two captures, first capturing the knight (3 points) and then the bishop (3 points). Black in return has won the queen (9 points). White comes out at a 3 point disadvantage and hence capturing the knight would have been a bad idea.

I have designated 20 puzzles for you to solve in regard to finding pieces that are not protected enough. Look for pieces that are attacked more than they are defended.

Remember: when possible, it is generally best to capture with the weakest piece first.
