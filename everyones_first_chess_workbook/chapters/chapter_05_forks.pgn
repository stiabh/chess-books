[Event "Chapter 5: Forks"]
{
A fork is when one piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at the same time. The unique thing about this motif is that every single piece on the board, including the king, can issue a fork. In this chapter, we break down forks according to the piece giving them.
}

[Event "Chapter 5: Knight Forks"]
[FEN "2k1q3/8/8/5N2/8/5K2/6Q1/8 w - - 0 1"]
{
The knight could move to d6 and fork the king and the queen. That would be an extremely powerful move since White would win a queen for only a knight...
}
1.Nd6+ Kd7 2.Nxe8.
{
... while White would end up losing a knight. It’s important to remember that the goal of any chess tactic is to gain an advantage, material or otherwise, and Nd6+ certainly does that. White wins a queen (9) and Black only gets the knight (3) in return. Knight forks are the trickiest of them all, and we will begin with those first.

[Event "Chapter 5: Rook Forks"]
[FEN "3k3n/8/8/8/8/6R1/8/4K3 w - - 0 1"]
{
Notice the king and the knight are on the same rank. White can use the rook to fork:
}
1.Rg8+ Ke7 2.Rxh8.
{
White wins a knight (3 points) for nothing and should go on to win the game.
}

[Event "Chapter 5: Queen Forks"]
[FEN "8/r5k1/8/8/8/8/8/3Q2K1 w - - 0 1"]
{
Notice that the rook is unprotected on a7. Rooks do not like to be attacked on diagonals. White can fork the king and rook:
}
1.Qd4+ Kh7 2.Qxa7+
{
White wins a rook (5 points) and should go on the win the game.
}

[Event "Chapter 5: Bishop Forks"]
[FEN "1k2N3/8/8/8/8/8/1B5r/2K5 w - - 0 1"]
{
Rooks do not like to be attacked on diagonals, since they only move vertically and horizontally. White can win the rook on h2:
}
1.Be5+ Kc8 2.Bxh2
{
White wins a rook (5 points) for free and should go on to win the game.
}

[Event "Chapter 5: King Forks"]
[FEN "1k6/8/8/8/7K/5b2/5n2/RB6 w - - 0 1"]
{
Kings can fork pieces too, they just have to be one square away! White can fork the bishop and knight:
}
1.Kg3
{
White will win one of the minor pieces (3 points) and should go on to win the game.
}

[Event "Chapter 5: Pawn Forks"]
[FEN "8/1k6/1p6/5n1n/8/7P/6P1/R5K1 w - - 0 1"]
{
Pawns can fork pieces but only pieces that are diagonally apart. White can play...
}
1.g4
{
... which forks the knights. White will win one of the knights (3 points) for a pawn (1 point) and should go on to win the game.
All-in-all there are 40 fork puzzles in the chapter. In order to better solve the problems, look for all checks and undefended pieces.
