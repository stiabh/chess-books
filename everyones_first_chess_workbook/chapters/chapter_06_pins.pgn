[Event "Chapter 6: Pins"]
{
A pin occurs when a linear moving piece (rook, queen, bishop) attacks an enemy piece, and if the piece moved, there would be an attack on a piece of greater value beyond it.
We break down pins into two categories:
1. Absolute pin
2. Relative pin
}

[Event "Chapter 6: Absolute Pin"]
[FEN "4n3/6k1/8/8/3r4/8/8/1KR1B3 w - - 0 1"]
{
An absolute pin occurs when the piece that’s first being attacked cannot move since it would place the king in danger. Moving a piece that’s in such a situation would be illegal, hence the name ‘absolute pin’.
White could play
}
1.Bc3
{
‘pinning’ the rook to the king. This would be an example of an absolute pin, since it would be illegal to move the rook.
White is now attacking the rook, and Black is unable to move away from the attack – an absolute pin. No matter what Black plays here, the black rook is lost:

[Event "Chapter 6: Relative Pin"]
[FEN "5k1q/8/8/8/3r4/1PB5/P1P5/1KR5 w - - 0 1"]
{
A relative pin is when a piece is attacked, and if it moves, a piece of greater value would be endangered. While in most cases, it’s not a good idea to move the piece which is being pinned, there are times when it’s possible; that is what makes the relative pin different from the ‘absolute pin’.
In this chapter, you will solve a variety of pin problems. To better solve the problems in this chapter, look for pieces aligned on the same line (diagonal, rank, or file).

[Event "Chapter 6: Attacking the Pinned Piece"]
[FEN "R4bk1/7p/8/1r4p1/8/6P1/6KP/7R w - - 0 1"]
{
An important concept regarding pins is ‘attacking the pinned piece’. Increasing the number of attackers on a pinned piece may allow for you to win the piece outright. Let’s take a look at the following example:
White’s rook on a8 is pinning the bishop to the king. At the present moment, White has one attacker on the bishop (Ra8), and Black one defender (Kg8). White would not get the better of the immediate trade, so it would be best for White to add another attacker (Rh1) on the bishop, which Black can otherwise not move. White could bring the rook from h1 to f1, and attack the bishop for the second time. Black would be unable to run away from the threat due to the pin, and would be unable to add an additional defender, which would lead to the loss of the bishop. The next puzzles involve ‘attacking the pinned piece’. To better solve these problems, it would be useful to find the pinned piece first, then see how to best attack it.
}

[Event "Chapter 6: Pin Protection"]
[FEN "1kb4R/1q6/P7/8/8/1Q6/8/1K6 w - - 0 1"]
{
The last important concept involving a pin is regarding the usefulness of a pinned piece in the defence. This section of the pins chapter displays that ‘pinned pieces do not protect’. In the case of an absolute pin, the pinned piece does not protect at all.
The following is an example of a helper checkmate, which took advantage of the fact that the bishop on c8 was in an absolute pin and could not capture the queen.
The best move for White is
}
1.Qxb7#
{
The pawn on a6 defends the queen and thus Black is in checkmate.
The last problems in the pins Chapter will feature examples of ‘attacking the pinned piece’. To better solve these problems, it would be useful to find the pinned piece first, then see how to best take advantage of it.
