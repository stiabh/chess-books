{
Checkmate ends the game. There is no more important skill to master than delivering the final blow. In this chapter, you will practice executing checkmates in one move.
The checkmates in this chapter are broken down into four categories:
1. Basic checkmates;
2. Helper or supporting checkmates;
3. Checkmates using a battery;
4. Back rank checkmates.

[FEN "6k1/7p/5Kp1/3p1n2/3Pp2r/6r1/1R4P1/8 w - - 0 1"]
{
In this section of the chapter, you will give checkmates where the king is checked from a safe distance. In the following example, White’s king is boxing in the black king on the back rank. White’s rook can check the king from b8 and issue a checkmate. Let’s see:
}
1.Rb8#
{The rook checks the black king on the 8th rank from a safe distance; the white king prevents Black’s escape to the 7th rank – checkmate.}


[Event "Chapter 4: Helper/Supporting Checkmates"]
[FEN "1k6/8/QK6/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1"]
{

A helper or supporting checkmate is one when you check from a very close distance and the checking piece is protected so that it cannot be captured by the king. Let’s take a look at the following example:
The white king is protecting the squares a7, b7, and c7. The white queen could use any of the squares to attack the black king since they are protected. Let’s see:
1.Qb7# (see diagram 2)
Checkmate! The white king is protecting the queen and therefore Black cannot capture. The king is the ‘helper’ or ‘supporting’ piece in this particular case. All pieces can serve as helpers in a checkmate as you will see in this section of the chapter.

[Event "Chapter 4: Battery Checkmates"]
[FEN "6k1/1R1Q2p1/8/8/8/8/8/4K3 w - - 0 1"]
{
A battery is when two pieces that move along the same line (rank, file or diagonal) partner up for an attack. A battery checkmate is when the result of the said attack is checkmate. A battery checkmate is a form of helper checkmate.
Note to student: when your pieces are lined up in a battery, they protect one another and act as two attackers together!
The rook and queen are aligned on the 7th rank. Because the rook and queen can both move horizontally, they protect one another in the form of a battery. With the correct move, White could end the game by checkmate:
}
1.Qxg7#
{
Notice that the rook protects (helps) the queen so that the king cannot capture.
}

[Event "Chapter 4: Back Rank Checkmates"]
[FEN "6k1/2R2ppp/8/8/8/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1"]
{
A back rank checkmate is a common type of checkmate that occurs when a queen or rook delivers check along the back rank, and the king cannot escape to the next rank forward, due to its own pieces. Generally it is good to have a pawn shield in front of your king. Having said that, a pawn shield that hasn’t moved blocks the king from moving forward which may lead to positions where a back rank checkmate is possible.
The best move for White is
}
1.Rc8#
{
White’s rook attacks the 8th rank and Black’s king is trapped by its own pawns, resulting in checkmate. The back rank checkmate is quite a common checkmate and in chess it’s important to keep an eye out for this pattern. We will look at more difficult versions of this checkmate later in the book.
