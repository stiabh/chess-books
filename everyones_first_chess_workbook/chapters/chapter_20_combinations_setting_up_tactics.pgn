This chapter will test to see how all of the ideas, tactics and patterns you’ve learned come together. In chess, we call the use of multiple themes to gain a winning advantage a ‘combination’. In this chapter, you will have to push yourself to a new limit. The goal of every chess player is to continue to increase the depth of their calculation ability. I look to help you with that in this chapter. To assist you with these problems, I have given you a guided hint for each puzzle. Let’s take a look at a few examples of the types of problems you will be solving in this chapter:

{
White noticed that the rook on h5 is unprotected and started with a temporary sacrifice:
}
1.Rxg8+
{
White wants to lure the king to the g8 to set Black up for a fork.
}
1...Kxg8 2.Qe8+
{
The whole idea! White gave away a rook (5) for a knight (3), but now gets the whole rook (5) back. When the smoke clears, White will be up a bishop:
}
2...Kg7 3.Qxh5
{
After a decoy setting up a fork, White obtained a winning advantage.
}
