In this chapter you will learn to give checkmate in two moves. That is, you make a move, your opponent makes a move, and then on your second turn you finish the game with checkmate. Every puzzle in this chapter features two consecutive checks which end the game in checkmate. You will not have to find checkmates which use ‘quiet moves’ or non-checks.

1.Qf7+

}
1...Kh8 2.Qh7#

And finally using the bishop to deliver helper checkmate.
Good luck with the rest of the checkmate in two puzzles! Remember that you must start by looking for all checks in the position. Don’t forget to look for some of the tactics you learned earlier in the book – pins, decoys, discovered checks, double checks, as they can be extremely helpful in checkmating your opponent!
Once again, in this chapter, every move of the sequence will be check. Analyze each check until you see how the game will end.
