{
A skewer occurs when a linear moving piece (queen, rook, or bishop) attacks an enemy piece and if that piece moves away there would be an attack on a less valuable piece beyond it. Sometimes a skewer is referred to as a ‘reverse pin’ since a pin occurs when a piece of less value is attacked, and if it moves, a piece of greater value would be in danger. A skewer is the opposite; the more valuable piece is the one first attacked.
Notice that the black king and rook are aligned on the 8th rank. White could move the rook to h8, skewering the king and rook.
The best move for White is
}
1.Rh8+
{
The king (the most valuable piece) is attacked first. The king has to dodge the attack but then the rook on a8 is lost.
}
1...Kc7 2.Rxa8
{
In order to solve the problems in this chapter, look for enemy pieces aligned on the same file, rank or diagonal.
