**Introduction to Chess Tactics**

This section of the workbook primarily deals with ‘chess tactics’. Chess tactics are extremely important to the game of chess. Tactics are moves that enable you to gain a winning advantage of sorts. A winning advantage could mean material gain or even checkmate. So that you do not get carried away with all the ways you can win, the final chapter in this section is defending against tactics and threats.
Because tactics are not always obvious at first sight it is best to learn them by theme. Each tactical theme is assigned its own chapter along with puzzles that represent the concept.

Remember that when solving the puzzles in this section, look for all forcing moves:

- Checks;
- Captures;
- Threats.

In addition, keep a close eye out for undefended pieces.

For a more thorough explanation refer to the ‘Workbook Solving Tips’ section in the Introduction.}
